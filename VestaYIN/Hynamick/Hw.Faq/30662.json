Please charge your phone in a cool, dry environment.</span>\n</p>\n<p  >\n <span>It is recommended that you close any background apps that you are not using when playing games. When playing games, the phone's CPU is under heavy strain and will generate considerable heat.</span>\n</p>\n<p  >\n <span>It is recommended that you use mobile data in locations with strong signal. Please don't run lots of third-party apps at once. This will both use considerable mobile data and cause the phone to heat up.</span>\n</p>\n<p  >\n <span>It is preferable that you make phone calls in locations with strong signal.</span>\n</p>\n<p  >\n<span>Huawei will release the latest software versions on its official website.
