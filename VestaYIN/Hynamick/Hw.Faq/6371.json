{"type":null,"faqId":6371,"title":"How long should the battery be charged for the first several timesï¼Ÿ","answer":"It is recommended that the customer service personnel answer this question as follows: When the battery is fully charged, the charging can be stopped. The process takes about 3&ndash;4 hours.<br />Previously, nickel-cadmium batteries that have the memory effect are used. If a nickel-cadmium battery is not fully charged for the first several times, the battery cannot be fully charged in future. Therefore, the charging duration should be longer for nickel-cadmium batteries.<br />The Li-ion batteries currently used have no memory effect. Therefore, the charging can be stopped only when a Li-ion battery is fully charged.","faqTypeId":null,"faqType":null,"useful":1,"unUseful":0,"languageId":1,"languageName":"en","faqCode":"6371","faqTypeCode":null,"isTop":"0","moduleCode":"faq","productId":null,"productCode":null,"postDate":1321929628000,"seriesProductName":"","visitedTimes":203,"isUsefulFlag":null,"score":1,"times":1,"imageList":null,"displayType":"text","justView":"0","fileName":null,"filePath":null,"imagePath":null,"imageName":null,"productIdList":null,"curPage":null,"pageSize":null,"siteCode":null,"statusFlag":"Publish","returnCode":0,"totalRows":null,"keywords":null,"avgScore":1.0,"createDate":null,"totalPages":null}
