  "answer": "Huawei TalkBand uses the innovative A2DP function thatsmartly allocates media audio.  \r\n\n1.        When your B1 is connected to your phone overBluetooth and the Bluetooth headset is on your wrist, the music will come outfrom your phone instead of your B1's Bluetooth headset.  \r\n\n2.        During music playback, if you take off yourBluetooth headset from your wrist, the music will come out from your headset.  \r\n\n3.        When the music is coming out from your Bluetoothheadset, if you put it back on your wrist, the music will automatically stop(this function may not be available on some media players).  \r\n\nHuawei has applied patentfor this function.",
