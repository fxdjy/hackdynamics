The screen brightness may not adjust properly if the light sensor is covered by other objects. \r\n\r\n Please adjust the screen brightness if you think the screen is too bright or too dark. Go to Settings and select Display > Brightness. \r\n\r\n Please adjust the color temperature if you think that the screen colors are too bright or too dark. Go to Settings, select Display > Color temperature, deselect Default and drag the slider to adjust the color temperature. \r\n\r\n For EMUI 2.3 or above, please check whether the phone has entered ultra power saving mode. In ultra power saving mode, the screen will become darker and you can only use the call, messaging and contacts functions. Touch the exit button to exit ultra power saving mode. \r\n\r\n If the screen was subjected to an impact, the internal liquid crystals may be damaged, causing problems with screen brightness or color. Please contact Huawei customer service or take your phone and purchase invoice to a service center for inspection. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
