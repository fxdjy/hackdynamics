  "answer": " Ensure that the microSD card is inserted properly. Please refer to the Quick Start that came with the phone. \r\n\r\n Check that the microSD card is compatible with your phone. Usually, the maximum supported card capacity is 32 GB. \r\n\r\n Ensure that the microSD card is not damaged. You can use a card reader to connect the microSD card to your computer or insert the card in another phone to check whether the card is damaged. \r\n\r\n The microSD card's data format is not compatible with your phone. It is recommended that you try again after reformatting the card on another phone or computer. \r\n\r\n If the card is still not recognized after attempting the preceding steps, it is recommended that you back up any important data and restore factory settings, or contact a service center for inspection. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
