  "answer": " Step 1 If your phone got wet, do not attempt to turn it on or off. If your phone uses a removable battery, please remove it immediately. \r\n\r\n Step 1 Please wipe any water from the phone and then place it in a highly water-absorbent environment, such as active carbon, rice, desiccant, for 48 hours. \r\n\r\n Step 1 Once your phone is dry, try switching it on. If the phone turns on but some features are not working (for example, the keyboard does not light up or the touchscreen does not respond), it could be due to a hardware fault. Please contact Huawei customer service or take your phone and purchase invoice to a service center for inspection. \r\n\r\n ![](http://consumer.huawei.com/support/servlet/imageServlet?dlType=HtmlAreaImage&imageId=97076)\r\n\r\n If your phone comes into contact with liquids such as coffee, coke, milk, or salt water, please take it to a service center as soon as possible. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
