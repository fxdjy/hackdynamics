  "title": "Why can't my B1 automatically reconnect to my phone after the Bluetooth connection is terminated?",
  "answer": " Your B1 may disconnect from your phone if they are too far away from each other. If you bring your B1 back within the range of your phone Bluetooth coverage within 3 minutes, it will automatically reconnect to your phone if Bluetooth on both devices are still on. \r\n\r\n However, if the disconnection lasts for more than 3 minutes, to minimize the energy consumption, your B1 will automatically turn off Bluetooth and the Bluetooth icon is off. Therefore, after your B1 enters the range of your phone Bluetooth coverage, you need to press the side button to turn it on, and then your B1 will automatically reconnect to your phone.",
