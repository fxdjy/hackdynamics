  "title": "How do I prevent personal data from being leaked from my phone?",
  "answer": " Some third-party apps may allow personal data on your phone to be leaked or deleted. You can download security apps for your phone which will scan the device and remove third-party malware. This will help keep your personal data safe. \r\n\r\n Your personal data is at risk when you use Wi-Fi hotspots in locations such as shopping centers, hotels, restaurants and cafes. Please take care when connecting to such hotspots. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
