  "answer": "**Freeing Up Your Phone's Internal Storage**\r\n\r\n**You may encounter the following situation: **\r\n\r\n**You install an application of 10 MB when there is 100 MB of available storage space, so the remaining storage space is 90 MB. Then you remove the application **\r\n\r\n**but only to find the remaining storage space becomes 98 MB. The 2 MB of storage space is taken up by system trash even though the application is removed. **\r\n\r\n**Then how do we clear the system trash?**\r\n\r\n**The following operations must be executed by the RE manager. **\r\n\r\nInstalling applications on an Android system: \r\n\r\nThe Android system is divided into two parts: SYSTEM and DATA. SYSTEM is the partition used by the phone system. \r\n\r\nDATA is the partition for users. All your system settings, installed applications, contacts, messages, and other data are saved in the DATA partition. The \"available storage space\" we usually mention refers to the remaining space in the DATA partition. \r\n\r\nOverview of the DATA partition:\r\n\r\nTo install an application to your Android phone, **app**, **dalvik-cache**, and **data** folders are involved. \r\n\r\n**app**: save location of the application, and also be deemed main body of the application \r\n\r\n**dalvik-cache**: application cache, including cache for applications in both the SYSTEM (ROM) and DATA partitions \r\n\r\n**data**: application settings (including settings for applications in both the SYSTEM and DATA partitions), parameters, default skin, images, and other data\r\n\r\nAfter you remove an application, the application is removed from **app**, but the data in **dalvik-cache** and **data **are not removed. \r\n\r\nTo solve this problem, remove the entire **dalvik-cache** folder. \r\n\r\nThen immediately restart your phone; otherwise all applications in your phone will be unavailable. The **dalvik-cache** folder will be automatically re-created after your phone restarts, containing cache for existing applications only. \r\n\r\nData: This folder is a bit tricky. Please perform the following procedure to handle it. \r\n\r\nTo remove an application, locate it using its internal name. \r\n\r\n![](http://consumer.huawei.com/support/servlet/imageServlet?dlType=SupportImage&imagePath=/20150601205623374001.jpg)\r\n\r\n![](http://consumer.huawei.com/support/servlet/imageServlet?dlType=SupportImage&imagePath=/20150601205624183002.jpg)\r\n\r\nFor example, **com.tencent.mobileqq** is QQ's internal name and **com.ucmobile** is the internal name of UC browser. \r\n Delete the application data from **app**, and go to the **data** folder to delet",
