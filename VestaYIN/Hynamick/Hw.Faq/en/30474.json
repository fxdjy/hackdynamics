The type of SIM/UIM card supported may differ according to the phone standard. Please contact the phone vendor for details. \r\n\r\n Please verify that the SIM/UIM card is valid. Please insert the SIM/UIM card into another phone to see if it functions properly. \r\n\r\n There is no network coverage. \r\n\r\n It could be that there is no signal due to poor network coverage. Please wait or move to a place with better signal and then try again. \r\n\r\n The SIM/UIM card has been disabled. \r\n\r\n For dual SIM phones, open Settings > SIM card management and confirm that the SIM/UIM card has been enabled. \r\n\r\n Flight mode is enabled. \r\n\r\n Please ensure that flight mode is not enabled on your phone. If flight mode is enabled, a flight mode icon will be displayed in the status bar. \r\n\r\n If there is still no signal, please restart your phone. \r\n\r\n If the problem persists, please contact Huawei customer service or take your phone and purchase invoice to a service center for inspection. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
