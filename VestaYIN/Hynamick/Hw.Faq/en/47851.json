  "answer": " Please refer to the Quick Start that came with the phone and ensure that the SIM/UIM card is correctly inserted. \r\n\r\n Check whether the phone can identify the SIM/UIM card inserted. Different phones support different types of SIM/UIM cards. Please contact your phone supplier for details. \r\n\r\n Check whether Internet access is activated for your SIM/UIM card. Please contact your network provider to activate Internet access. \r\n\r\n Check whether your SIM/UIM card has run out of credit. The network provider may stop providing Internet access to SIM/UIM cards that have no calling credit. \r\n\r\n Check if you have set a mobile data limit. If you have set a limit, you will not be able to connect to the Internet via mobile data when the limit has been reached. \r\n\r\n Go to Settings, select More > Data usage (EMUI 2.0 and EMUI 2.3) or Data traffic management (EMUI 3.0), turn off the mobile data limit or set a higher limit. \r\n\r\n Reset the access point to default settings. \r\n\r\n For EMUI 2.0 and EMUI 2.3, go to Settings, select Mobile networks > Access Point Names, open the options menu and select Reset to default. Reconnect after completing configuration. \r\n\r\n For EMUI 3.0, go to Settings, select More > Mobile networks > Access Point Names, open the options menu and select Reset to default. Reconnect after completing configuration. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
