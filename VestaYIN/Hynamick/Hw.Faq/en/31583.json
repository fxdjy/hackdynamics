  "title": "What is the standby time and working time of the TalkBand B2?",
  "answer": " With light use, the standby time is generally between 4 to 5 days. With heavy use, the standby time is generally between 1 to 2 days (using it to make calls more than 4 hours a day or listen to WeChat voice messages or music often). \r\n\r\n The battery's working time depends on how often you use the TalkBand B2 and how you use it. The TalkBand B2 comes with a touchscreen and exercise statistic collection feature that regular Bluetooth headsets do not have. The TalkBand B2 supports a calling time of about 6 hours, which is much longer than that of the regular Bluetooth headsets. \r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n",
