  "title": "I cannot open web pages sometimes over a Wi-Fi connection. Why?",
  "answer": "Possible causes are as follows:\r\n\r\n * The x digital subscriber line (xDSL) connection fails. If the hotspot (such as a wireless router) your phone connects to accesses the internet through xDSL and the xDSL connection fails, the internet connection is unavailable. Check that the xDSL connection is working properly and try again.   \r\n * A domain name service (DNS) issue occurs. For example, if you cannot open web pages but can access Play Store, the DNS is not working properly. In this case, on the screen where a static IP address can be set, modify DNS settings.   \r\n * The websites that the Wi-Fi hotspot can access are restricted. If the internet connection of the hotspot is restricted, your phone can not be used to browse web pages.",
