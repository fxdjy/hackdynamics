  "title": "Why do the steps counted by the TalkBand B2 differ from those counted by my phone?",
  "answer": " The TalkBand B2 features a state-of-the-art 6-axis sensor to ensure the accuracy of step counting. Through extensive testing with other major wrist bands, Huawei's R&D team found that the TalkBand B2's step counting accuracy is high when you are continuously walking or running. There are two scenarios where the TalkBand B2'sÂ step counting statistics may differ from others: \r\n\r\n 1. The TalkBand B2 does not count \"steps\" when you wave your arms around while standing or working in the office, having meals, or brushing your teeth. Other less imprecise devices may incorrectly count these motions steps. \r\n\r\n 2. If you wave your arms regularly for a long period of time, the data obtained by the acceleration sensor will be similar to that when you are walking. In this case, your TalkBand B2 may identify you as walking and lead to an inaccurate step count. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
