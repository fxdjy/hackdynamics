  "answer": " Your TalkBand B2 makes finding your phone a breeze. \r\n\r\n Make sure your TalkBand B2 is connected to your phone using Bluetooth. Press and hold the side button on your TalkBand and swipe to the phone finding screen. Touch the TalkBand B2's screen to start searching. Your phone vibrates or beeps when it's within range. \r\n\r\n This feature requires Android 4.0 or later or iOS 7.0 or later. (If you are using phones other than P8 and P8 max, make sure the Huawei Wear application is running on your phone before you use this feature.) \r\n\n\n\n\n",
