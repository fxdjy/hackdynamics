  "title": "Are there any risks with flashing a phone?",
  "answer": " After flashing your phone, there may be deterioration in performance and some features might not work properly. In addition, because third-party firmware is not fully tested, it could cause compatibility issues or make your system susceptible to viruses and other attacks. \r\n\r\n Flashing your phone can have unexpected consequences, please exercise caution. If your device ceases to function properly and cannot be recovered, you are fully responsible. \r\n\r\n For software or hardware faults caused by flashing the phone, Huawei after-sales service centers can offer a repair outside the warranty and charge the normal out-of-warranty software repair fee. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
