  "answer": "**Removing Dust from Your Phone**\r\n\r\nIf you are used to placing your phone in your pocket or purse, dust will enter the receiver and charging port as time goes by. \r\n\r\nIf there is not much dust, you can remove the dust yourself by performing the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. Tear off a piece of double-sided tape or transparent tape into stripes. \r\n\r\n2. Approach the speaker, receiver, and charging port with the tape to attach the dust to the tape. \r\n\r\n3. For dust difficult to remove, use a toothpick to insert the tape into the port and try to remove the dust.",
