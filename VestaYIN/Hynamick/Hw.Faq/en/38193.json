  "answer": " There is a proximity sensor located above the screen near the receiver. \r\n\r\n During a call, the screen will automatically turn off to prevent unintended operations when the phone is close to your ear or when other objects cover the area above the screen. The screen will turn back on again when the object is moved away from the screen. \r\n\r\n If the screen does not turn back on during a call when you move the phone away from your ear, please press the power button to turn the screen on and check whether there is anything covering the area above the screen. \r\n\r\n ![](http://consumer.huawei.com/support/servlet/imageServlet?dlType=HtmlAreaImage&imageId=123286)\r\n\r\n In order to ensure that the phone works properly, please do not use a phone cover or other object to cover the receiver or screen near the receiver. When using a screen protector, please do not cover the sensor. We recommend that you purchase a screen protector designed for your phone model. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
