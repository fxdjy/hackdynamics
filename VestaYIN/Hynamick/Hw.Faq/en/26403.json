  "answer": "**Cleaning a White Headset**\r\n\r\nThe headset cable is usually made of TPU, which provides good elasticity and exquisite handfeeling, is not prone to scratches, and does not easily get yellowish. If your headset cable gets dirty, you can try rubbing the headset cable with an eraser or wiping it with a towel soaked in hot water that contains detergent. \r\n\r\nIf the headset cable is still not clean enough, try the foam detergent used to clean cars' interior surfaces. Detailed steps are as follows: \r\n\r\n1. Wind the headset cable into a bundle and place it into a plastic bag. \r\n\r\n2. Cover the cable with the foam detergent, which is similar to shaving foam but with strong spurt force. \r\n\r\n3. Gently rub the headset cable with your hands. \r\n\r\n4. Keep the headset cable in the plastic bag for two hours. You will find that the foam becomes yellowish and the headset cable is restored to white. \r\n\r\n5. Take out the headset cable and wipe off the foam. \r\n\r\nNote: As time goes by, headsets inevitably will get broken or torn.",
