  "title": "I cannot connect my phone using an OTG cable",
  "answer": "l   When connecting an OTG cable to your phone, the phone acts like a card reader. Please check whether your phone supports a microSD card and the USB drive function. If not, please use another phone.\r\n\r\nl   Check whether the microSD card was inserted into the phone correctly.\r\n\r\nl   If a microSD card has already been inserted, check whether USB drive mode is activated on the connected phone.\r\n\r\nl   When using an OTG cable to connect your phone to a USB storage device, the phone will provide power to the device. Some USB storage devices that have a high power rating such as portable hard drives or phones may not function properly.",
