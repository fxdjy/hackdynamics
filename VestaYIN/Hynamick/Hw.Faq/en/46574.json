  "answer": "If the ![](http://app.huawei.com/tkb/ha-i/733c5_rkkxk.png \"click to enlarge\") icon is displayed on your watch, this indicates that the Bluetooth connection with your phone was interrupted.\r\n\r\nYour phone will attempt to re-establish the connection with your watch. The connection will normally be re-established within 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nIf the connection was not re-established after 5 minutes, disable the Bluetooth connection in the Android Wear app and then attempt to reconnect.",
