  "answer": "l   If this happens during a call:\r\n\r\nThis is normal. Your phone has a proximity sensor that's installed near the earpiece. When your ear or other object triggers the proximity sensor, the screen automatically turns off. The screen turns back on when the object blocking the proximity sensor is moved away.\r\n\r\nDo not block the area around the earpiece with the phone cover or other objects.\r\n\r\nl   If this happens when a third-party application is running:\r\n\r\nThe application may not be compatible with your phone. Uninstall the application in question. If the problem persists, back up important data and restore your phone to its factory settings.\r\n\r\nl   If this happens when you are running multiple applications simultaneously:\r\n\r\nOn the **Phone Manager** screen, touch **Phone accelerator**, and follow the onscreen instructions to close applications not in use.\r\n\r\n![](http://consumer.huawei.com/support/servlet/imageServlet?dlType=SupportImage&imagePath=/20141202183324951001.jpg)![](http://consumer.huawei.com/support/servlet/imageServlet?dlType=SupportImage&imagePath=/20141202183324252002.jpg)",
