  "title": "Why does my TalkBand B2 display cycling statistics even though I didn't ride a bicycle?",
  "answer": " If you are driving, taking a bus, or in similar scenarios, your TalkBand B2 may mistakenly identify you as riding a bicycle because the statistics received by the acceleration sensor in these scenarios are similar to those when you are riding a bike. \r\n\r\n Our R&D team is working hard on improving this feature to provide you with more accurate fitness statistics. \r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n",
