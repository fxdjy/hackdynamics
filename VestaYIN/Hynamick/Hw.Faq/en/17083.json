  "answer": "l   During the call, press the volume up button to increase the call volume.\r\n\r\nl   Make calls in quiet places with good reception.\r\n\r\nl   When you are holding the phone, make sure the earpiece is aligned with your ear.\r\n\r\nl   Do not block the microphone with your finger or other object. Speak close to the microphone.\r\n\r\nl   Use the Huawei original headset for calls. Other headsets may not be compatible with your phone.\r\n\r\nl   Restart your phone or back up important data and restore your phone to its factory settings. \r\n\r\nIf the problem persists, contact Huawei technical support or take your phone to an authorized Huawei service center.",
