  "title": "Why do I hear noise when I use the TalkBand B2 for Bluetooth calling?",
  "answer": " Noise may sometimes result from environmental interference. For example, your phone may be connected to a Wi-Fi network or you may be near a strong router or microwave oven. \r\n\r\n Bluetooth is a short-distance and ultra-low radiation transmission technology. We suggest the following when you use the Bluetooth headset for calling: \r\n\r\n 1. Keep your TalkBand B2 within 5 meters from the phone, without large obstacles between them. \r\n\r\n 2. During the call, keep the Bluetooth headset and phone on the same side of your body to make sure the signals are not blocked. \r\n\r\n 3. Turn off Wi-Fi on your phone or keep away from microwave sources, such as microwave ovens and high functioning routers. \r\n\r\n If the noise is periodic, it's probably due to normal environmental interference. If the noise is constant, takeÂ your TalkBand B2 to an authorized Huawei service center.\n",
