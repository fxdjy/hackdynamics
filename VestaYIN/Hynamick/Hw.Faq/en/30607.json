  "answer": " On Android phones, most third-party apps are installed to the internal storage by default and cannot be installed to the microSD card directly. Some phone models allow apps to be moved from the internal storage to the microSD card. \r\n\r\n Once apps have been moved to the microSD card, if the card is unmounted, formatted or removed from the phone, the app will no longer be accessible. \r\n\r\n On the Settings screen, select Manage apps. Select the app you wish to move and transfer it to the microSD card. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
