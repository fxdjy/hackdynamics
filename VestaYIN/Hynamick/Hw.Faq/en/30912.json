  "title": "The volume is too low when listening to music using a headset",
  "answer": " You can turn up the volume using the volume up button when music is playing. \r\n\r\n Check if there are any objects blocking the earphones. Please clean the earphones on a regular basis. \r\n\r\n Try playing a ringtone file with the volume turned up to see whether there is a problem with the audio source. If there is a problem with the audio source, try again after changing the file. \r\n\r\n As the phone's output voltage is limited, music may not play properly when using a high-spec, high-fidelity headset. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
