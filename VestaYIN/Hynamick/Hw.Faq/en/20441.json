  "title": "What are the functions of my fingerprint on the Mate7?",
  "answer": "You can enroll five sets of fingerprints in normal mode and visitor mode respectively, and open applications using those fingerprints. For example, instead of entering the password, you can use your fingerprint to unlock your screen, log in to your cloud account, unlock your applications, and access your file safe.   \r\n You can set all these functions on the Fingerprint ID screen.\r\n\r\n Create a fingerprint and enroll it to your fingerprint list.   \r\n The fingerprint sensor can be used as a touch-sensitive button. In Camera, press and hold the sensor for 1 second to take a photo. This function is especially convenient for taking selfies. \r\n\r\n 1. App lock   \r\n If you don't want others to open some applications, such as WeChat, on your phone, use the fingerprint function to lock them. These applications can only be unlocked when you enter your fingerprint. Go to Settings > Fingerprint ID, and enable the application lock function. Go to Phone Manager > App lock, set the app lock password, and choose applications you want to lock. \r\n\r\n 2. Safe   \r\n You can store your financial and other private files in the safe and lock the safe using your fingerprint.   \r\n Go to Settings > Fingerprint ID, and turn on Access safe.   \r\n Go to File manager > Categories > Safe, set the safe password, and choose files to be protected.  \r\n\r\n3. Visitor mode and normal mode   \r\n Your phone supports visitor mode and normal mode. In visitor mode, your private information is blocked.   \r\n Press your right finger against the sensor to enter normal mode and press your left finger to enter visitor mode. For example, when your child is playing with your phone, set your phone to visitor mode.   \r\n Go to Settings > Fingerprint ID, and set your PIN or password and enroll your fingerprint.   \r\n Go to Settings > Security > Privacy & security, enter the PIN or password, and the fingerprint to unlock the screen will be displayed.   \r\n\r\n Then you can select the content you want to keep private in visitor mode. To view the owner fingerprint and visitor fingerprint, go to Settings > Security > Privacy & security > Manage fingerprint.   \r\n When your screen is off or locked, enter visitor mode or owner mode using corresponding fingerprint.",
