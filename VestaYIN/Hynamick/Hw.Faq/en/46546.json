  "answer": "If the watch fails to detect your heart rate or displays significantly different readings within a short period of time, follow the steps below:\r\n\r\n*   Ensure that you have removed the transparent protective film on the back of the watch.\r\n*   Ensure that the back of the watch is clean and dry and that there are no objects between the back of the watch and your wrist.\r\n*   Check that you are wearing the watch properly. The watch should sit comfortably on your wrist. Do not wear the watch too tight or too loose.\r\n*   Keep your wrist still and avoid shaking it when testing your heart rate.\r\n*   If the watch doesn't detect your heart rate after numerous attempts, restart your watch and try again. If the watch still doesn't detect your heart rate, contact your local Huawei service center for support.",
