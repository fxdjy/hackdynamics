  "title": "How do I use the smart alarm?",
  "answer": " The smart alarm clock allows you to set a reminder time ahead of your alarm time. During the period between your reminder time and alarm time, if you are in light sleep, your TalkBand B2 will remind you ahead of time. If you are in deep sleep, your TalkBand B2 will wake you up at the alarm time. \r\n\r\n Before you set a smart alarm, make sure the Bluetooth connection between the TalkBand B2 and your phone is normal. After you set a smart alarm, the alarm takes effect after you go back to the home screen from the settings screen. If the Bluetooth connection between the TalkBand B2 and your phone is abnormal when you set the smart alarm, the alarm will take effect after you re-open the Huawei Wear application and sync data with a normal Bluetooth connection. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
