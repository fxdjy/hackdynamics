  "answer": "l   If you are using the phone for the first time:\r\n\r\nCharge your phone for about half an hour before powering it on.\r\n\r\nWhen your phone powers on for the first time, the system needs to be initialized, which may take a while. Please wait patiently.\r\n\r\nl   If you just restored your phone to its factory settings or updated it:\r\n\r\nPlease wait patiently because the system needs to be initialized, which may take a while.\r\n\r\nIf the screen freezes, press and hold the power button for 10 seconds or more to forcibly restart your phone.\r\n\r\nl   If your phone powers off during normal use and can't power on again:\r\n\r\nThe battery level may be too low. Charge your phone for a while and try again.\r\n\r\nl   If the problem persists:\r\n\r\nContact Huawei technical support or take your phone to an authorized Huawei service center.\r\n\r\nHuawei releases updates at its official website from time to time.
