  "answer": " 1. Set up a Bluetooth connection between the TalkBand B2 and your phone. \r\n\r\n 2. Grant your TalkBand B2 the access to your phone contacts. If you denied the access by mistake, restart your TalkBand B2 and grant it the access again. \r\n\r\n 3. If duplicate contacts exist on your phone, the contact name may not be displayed. We are trying to solve this issue in the update version. \r\n\r\n 4. Some phones (such as Samsung phones) are not able to push contacts names saved in your SIM card to the TalkBand B2. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
