  "title": "P7 What can I do if my phone generates excessive heat?",
  "answer": " It is normal for smartphones to generate heat while you are charging, playing games, surfing the Internet, making calls, or using other power-intensive functions. \r\n\r\n lDo not surf the Internet, play games, watch videos, or use other power-intensive applications while your phone is charging. Charge your phone in a cool and dry place. \r\n\r\n lWhile you are playing games, close applications you do not need to use. Playing games increases the workload on the CPU, which leads to excessive heat. \r\n\r\n lUse the mobile network and make calls in places with good reception. \r\n\r\n lDo not run too many applications simultaneously to avoid abrupt increases in heat generated by your phone. \r\n\r\n Huawei releases updates on its official website from time to time.
