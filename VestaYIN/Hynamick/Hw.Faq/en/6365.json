  "answer": "Yes, it does. By default, the recordings are stored in the My Ringtones folder of the phone memory. You can change the storage location to save recordings on the microSD card by selecting Menu->Tools-> Recorder -> Options -> Storage location. When you open a recorded audio on the phone, by default the music player will be launched to play the audio. You can also transfer the audios to a PC via Bluetooth or using a microSD card, and then play the audios using the media player on the PC.",
