  "answer": " Use either of the following methods: \r\n\r\n Method 1: When your TalkBand B2 is connected to your phone through Bluetooth, you can view the TalkBand B2's battery level on the Huawei Wear application's settings screen. The battery level is displayed as a percentage. \r\n\r\n Method 2: Wake up the TalkBand B2's screen to view the battery level displayed in bars. (The battery level is displayed as a percentage only when the TalkBand B2 is charging.) \r\n\r\n If you want to view the specific remaining battery level, go to the Huawei Wear application. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
