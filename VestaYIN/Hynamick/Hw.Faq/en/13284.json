  "answer": " A: \r\n\r\n  1.Check whether the adpter is standard.If not,please use the standard adapter to charge.The power supplied by the adpter is more reliable than the one supplied by the computer with USB cable. \r\n\r\n 2.The case temperature will get high after a long time using.You'd better pause using and charge your E5.Security risk exists when E5 is being charged with a high temperature. \r\n\r\n Third,if the battery is over-discharge,the charging tips will occur after 5min charging. \r\n\r\n 3.If the battery is over-discharge, plug in the charger when it is not shown, you need to wait 5min trickle charge after charging to display \r\n\r\n 4.Ff the battery voltage is  high, we make some designs to extend battery life such as consider temporarily out of battery life without recharging .So there may not be charging tips when it is be pluged in the adapter .",
