  "title": "The Internet is very slow when using one of the SIM cards on a dual SIM phone",
  "answer": "Dual card phones allow two SIM cards to be used in parallel. Often, the main card slot supports 3G SIM cards (4G on some phones) and the secondary slot supports 2G cards. Some phones now support dual 4G or 3G SIM cards.\r\n\r\nIf a 3G or 4G SIM card is used in the main card slot and a 2G card is used in the secondary slot, the Internet on the main SIM card will be noticeably faster as it uses 3G or 4G, both of which are faster than 2G.\r\n\r\nIf Internet access is slow when using a 3G or 4G SIM card, please verify that your phone has a strong enough signal.",
