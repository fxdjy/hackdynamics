  "answer": " Please do not lose the Bluetooth headset since it's a vital part of your TalkBand B2. It is recommended that you re-attach the headset to the strap immediately after ending a call or listening to music. \r\n\r\n The TalkBand B2 has a disconnection reminder feature, that is, your phone will inform you when the Bluetooth connection between the TalkBand B2 and your phone is disconnected.(you should keep the Anti-theft reminder on in App) \r\n\n\n\n\n",
