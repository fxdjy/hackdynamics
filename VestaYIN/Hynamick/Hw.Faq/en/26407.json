  "answer": "**Entering Safe Mode**\r\n\r\nDid you install an application on your phone but only to find the phone cannot start up properly or unexpectedly restarts? Do you know how to solve this problem?\r\n\r\nYour phone supports safe mode. In this mode, the minimum number of applications are available. Uninstall the application in question and restart your phone. If the problem persists, try another application. \r\n\r\nYou can enter safe mode using either of the following methods:\r\n\r\n1. Power on the phone. After the first animation appears, press and hold the volume down button until your phone vibrates. \r\n\r\n2. Press and hold the power button, touch and hold **Power off**, and touch **OK**. After your phone enters safe mode, **Safe mode** is displayed in its lower left corner. \r\n\r\nTo exit safe mode, simply restart your phone.\r\n\r\nAll third-party applications are disabled in safe mode, so you can uninstall the application in question easily.",
