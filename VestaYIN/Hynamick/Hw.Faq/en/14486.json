  "answer": "  The network is busy, or the signal reception is poor. \r\n\r\n Solution: Try again later.  \r\n  The message is denied by the network (MMS center).  \r\n − Reason 1: The recipient number is invalid.  \r\n − Solution: Check that the recipient number is correct and try again.  \r\n − Reason 2: The multimedia message exceeds the maximum size allowed by your  \r\n service provider (generally 300 KB).  \r\n − Solution: Delete some content from the multimedia message to make sure that it is  \r\n smaller than the maximum size, and try again.  \r\n  Your balance is insufficient.  \r\n Solution: Top up your account and try again.  \r\n  Your phone is running out of available storage space.  \r\n Solution: Delete some files from your phone to free up at least 300 KB storage space.",
