  "answer": " 1）  On-device Data Usage Meter \r\n\r\n Your device includes an on-screen meter which displays amount of data used and remaining days left till your data usage is refreshed. \r\n\r\n Please note that the usage meter may take up to 48 hours to update. \r\n\n![](http://consumer.huawei.com/support/servlet/imageServlet?dlType=HtmlAreaImage&imageId=37525)\n\r\n\r\n You will be notified when you have reached 50%, 85% and more than 100% of included data. Notifications will pop up intermittently, switching between the homescreen and notification. \r\n\r\n 1）  Device Home page usage meter \r\n\r\n The status bar at the top of your Wi-Fi home page shows a data usage meter similar to the one displayed on your device which shows amount of data used and remaining days left till your data usage is refreshed. \r\n\r\n This status bar will also notify you when your usage has reached 50%, 85% and more than 100% of included data. \r\n\r\n ![](http://consumer.huawei.com/support/servlet/imageServlet?dlType=HtmlAreaImage&imageId=37526)",
