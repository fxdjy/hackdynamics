  "title": "When I listen to music over the Bluetooth headset of my B1, how is the music processed?",
  "answer": " Huawei TalkBand uses the innovative A2DP function that smartly allocates media audio. \r\n\r\n 1.  When your B1 is connected to your phone over Bluetooth and the Bluetooth headset is on your wrist, the music will come out from your phone instead of your B1's Bluetooth headset. \r\n\r\n 2.  During music playback, if you take off your Bluetooth headset from your wrist, the music will come out from your headset. \r\n\r\n 3.  When the music is coming out from your Bluetooth headset, if you put it back on your wrist, the music will automatically stop (this function may not be available on some media players). \r\n\r\n Huawei has applied patent for this function.",
