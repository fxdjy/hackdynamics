  "title": "How do I use gestures to wake up the screen or switch between different pages?",
  "answer": " You can wake up the screen by pressing the physical button or using smart gestures: \r\n\r\n Method 1: Press the side button. \r\n\r\n Method 2: Wear the TalkBand B2 and keep your wrist level. Keeps the Bluetooth headset screen facing away from you vertical to the ground. Quickly rotate your wrist 90 degrees so the Bluetooth headset'sÂ screen is facing you. Wait for about 1 second for the screen to wake up. You may need to try this motion a few times to find an optimal rotation speed. \r\n\r\n Method 3: Wear the TalkBand B2 and relax your arm. The screen will wake up when you raise your hand. \r\n\r\n If you wake up the screen by rotating your wrist, you can switch between different pages by consecutively rotating your wrist. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
