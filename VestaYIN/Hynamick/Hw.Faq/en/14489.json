  "title": "Can my computer use my phone's data connection through Bluetooth? Can I play games with other devices using Bluetooth?",
  "answer": "Yes. You can set up connection between your computer and phone using Bluetooth. The  \r\n\ncomputer can then use your phone's data connection to access the Internet. You can also  \r\n\nconnect your phone to other Bluetooth-capable devices and play games together.  \r\n\nYour phone supports the Personal Area Network (PAN) Profile. Other devices can share your  \r\n\nphone's data connection.  \r\n\nTo share your phone's data connection using Bluetooth, touch Settings > More... > Tethering  \r\n\r\n & portable hotspot, and select Bluetooth tethering. \r\n\r\n Your phone supports Bluetooth games. The method of using this function varies with the  \r\n third-party game. General steps are as follows:  \r\n 1. Search for other Bluetooth devices.  \r\n 2. Pair your phone with another device.  \r\n 3. Start the game.",
