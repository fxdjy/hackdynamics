  "title": "How do I navigate with offline maps?",
  "answer": " Open the navigation app and download the offline map package that you require. When downloading maps, it is recommended that you switch off mobile data and use a Wi-Fi connection. After downloading the map, you can navigate offline. When navigating offline, a mobile data connection is not needed. However, the GPS must still be switched on and the phone must be in a location with strong GPS signal. This is preferably an outdoor location with no surrounding buildings. \r\n\r\n Different navigation apps have different functions. It is recommended that you log in to Play Store and download a navigation app that supports offline maps. \r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n",
