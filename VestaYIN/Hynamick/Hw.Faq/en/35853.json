  "answer": " Touch Settings > Power saving > Normal. \r\n\r\n Touch Phone Manager > Phone accelerator to kill apps that you are not currently using. \r\n\r\n Open Phone Manager. For EMUI 2.0 or EMUI 2.3, select Storage cleaner; for EMUI 3.0, select Phone accelerator > Storage cleaner and then follow the on-screen prompts to clear junk from your phone. \r\n\r\n Restart your phone. \r\n\r\n If the game dimensions do not match the phone's screen, the phone must scale the game for compatibility, which will affect performance. If the game features lots of special effects or uses the phone's sensors, this will also affect gaming performance. \r\n\r\n If the preceding methods do not speed up your phone, it is recommended that you back up any important data and then restore factory settings. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
