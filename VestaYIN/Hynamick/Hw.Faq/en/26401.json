  "answer": "**Calibrating the Battery**\r\n\r\n**This document introduces a universal method for calibrating batteries on Android phones.**\r\n\r\n**Instead of using third-party applications, try the following method to calibrate your battery: **\r\n\r\n**1. Power on your phone and charge it using a charger or computer. **\r\n\r\n**2. If the LED turns green, the battery is fully charged. Disconnect your phone from the charger. **\r\n\r\n**3. Power off your phone, connect it to the charger again, and wait until the LED turns green.**** **\r\n\r\n**4. Disconnect your phone from the charger. **\r\n\r\n**5. Power on your phone. Once the phone starts up completely, quickly power it off.**** **\r\n\r\n**6. Connect your phone to the charger and wait until the LED turns green. **\r\n\r\n**Note: **\r\n\r\n**1. The battery only needs to be calibrated once. Calibrating the battery for multiple times will not increase the battery's activity.**\r\n\r\n**2. If the battery performance is not improved after you perform the preceding procedure, replace the battery.**",
