  "title": "Why does my watch sometimes mistakenly identify my motion state (running)? Why is the number of steps displayed on my watch sometimes different from my actual number of steps?",
  "answer": "The watch's exercise algorithm is designed to approximately record data for longer periods of exercise. View your exercise data after exercising for a certain period of time.
