  "title": "How do I choose the customized wakeup keywords to achieve a better wakeup experience?",
  "answer": "1.l A wakeup keyword should contain at least four syllables (four characters for the wakeup keyword in Chinese). \r\n\r\n2.l The wakeup keyword should cover as more syllables as possible, instead of similar or repeated syllables. \r\n\r\n3.l The difference between adjacent syllables in the wakeup keyword should be as large as possible. For example, the difference between adjacent syllables of wakeup keyword \"Kaiyue online\" is large, while that of wakeup keyword \"Yuyin online\" is small. \r\n\r\n4.l A good wakeup keyword has the following features: large mouth opening degree, large loudness, clear pronounce, and compound finals for vowels. \r\n\r\n5.l The wakeup keyword can be the word that is rarely used. \r\n\n\n\n",
