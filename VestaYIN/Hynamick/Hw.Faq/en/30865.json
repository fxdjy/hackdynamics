  "title": "The battery does not charge properly",
  "answer": " If the battery is completely discharged, connect the battery charger and wait for 5 minutes then check to see whether it is charging properly. \r\n\r\n Use the included charger to charge the battery. If you are still unable to charge the battery when using the charger provided, remove and reinsert the USB cable, change the extension socket or restart the phone. \r\n\r\n The phone might not charge if it overheats. \r\n\r\n Huawei phones feature a special heat-protective design. The charging process will stop when the phone overheats. \r\n\r\n It is not recommended to play games, watch videos, browse the Internet or use other similar power-intensive functions when the battery is charging. \r\n\r\n When using a portable battery charger, ensure that the output current is suitable for your phone. For example: The current provided by the charger included is 1 A. If the portable charger provides a current greater than or less than 1 A, this may result in the battery failing to charge. If you are still unable to charge the battery, use the data cable provided to connect to the portable charger. \r\n\r\n If the problem persists, please contact Huawei customer service or take your phone and purchase invoice to a service center for inspection. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
