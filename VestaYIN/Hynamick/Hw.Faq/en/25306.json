  "answer": " The battery's capacity will decrease rapidly if it is not used for more than 6 months. Do not leave the battery idle for long periods. \r\n\r\n Wherever possible, use the battery charger provided to charge the battery. \r\n\r\n Do not wait until the battery level is low before charging. Try to charge the battery whenever you can to prolong its lifespan. \r\n\r\n Avoid using the phone when it is charging. \r\n\r\n After the battery is fully charged, promptly disconnect the battery charger. Charging the battery for too long may reduce the lifespan of the battery and charger. \r\n\r\n Do not subject the battery to high or low temperatures or large temperature fluctuations. This reduces the lifespan of the battery. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
