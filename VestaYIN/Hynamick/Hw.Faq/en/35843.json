  "answer": " If the battery is removable, this problem could be due to a bad contact. \r\n\r\n After removing the battery, use a cotton cloth moistened with alcohol to wipe the contacts on the phone and battery. Reinsert the battery and then turn on the phone. \r\n\r\n Press and hold the power button to open the options menu and then select Restart. \r\n\r\n If you cannot open the options menu: for phones with removable batteries, please remove and then reinsert the battery; for phones with non-removable batteries, please press and hold the power button until the phone vibrates, in order to force a restart. \r\n\r\n If after restarting the phone, it continues to turn off or restart on its own, this could be due to an incompatible third-party app. \r\n\r\n It is recommended that you back up any important data and then restore factory settings. \r\n\r\n If you are unable to use your phone, please perform a forced update. After the update, the data in your phone's internal storage will be erased. \r\n\r\n Visit the [Huawei Downloads Page](http://consumer.huawei.com/en/support/downloads/index.htm%22 \\o %22 ) to search for and download a software update package for your model. Please refer to the update instructions contained in the package. \r\n\r\n If the problem persists, please contact Huawei customer service or take your phone and purchase invoice to a service center for inspection. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
