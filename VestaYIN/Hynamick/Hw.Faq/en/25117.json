  "answer": " This is entirely normal. When the phone is close to your head, the proximity sensor near the receiver is covered, which turns the screen off automatically to prevent unintended operations. When you move the phone away from your head, the screen will turn back on automatically. \r\n\r\n In order to ensure that the phone functions properly, please do not use a phone cover or other object to cover the portion of screen close to the receiver. When attaching a screen protector, ensure that it does not come into contact with the proximity sensor. Covers that are not very transparent will impair the functioning of the proximity sensor. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
