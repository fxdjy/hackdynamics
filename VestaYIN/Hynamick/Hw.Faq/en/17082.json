  "title": "What can I do if the screen is still off after I move my phone away from my ear?",
  "answer": "Your phone has a proximity sensor that's installed near the earpiece.\r\n\r\nWhen your ear or other object triggers the proximity sensor, the screen automatically turns off. The screen turns back on when the object blocking the proximity sensor is moved away.\r\n\r\nIf the screen is still off after you move your phone away from your ear, make sure the upper part of the screen is not blocked by another object.\r\n\r\n![](http://consumer.huawei.com/support/servlet/imageServlet?dlType=SupportImage&imagePath=/20141208140741346001.png)\r\n\r\nDo not block the area around the earpiece with the phone cover or other objects. When you attach a protective film to the screen, make sure it does not block the proximity sensor. It is recommended that you use the protective film dedicated to your phone.",
