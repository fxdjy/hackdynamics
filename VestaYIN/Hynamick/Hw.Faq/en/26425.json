  "answer": "**Taking Care of Your Phone Camera**\r\n\r\nSometimes poor photo quality is resulted from lack of care, for example, there might be dust inside the camera or the camera may be scratched. \r\n\r\nHow about attaching a protective film to the camera to protect it? Some users may be worried that the photo quality will be affected. Recommended methods are as follows: \r\n\r\n1. Keep and carry your phone in a clean place. \r\n\r\n2. Regularly clean the camera with cleaning paper. You can apply some alcohol if necessary. Do not use tissue to wipe the camera lens in case leaving tissue scraps on it. Exercise caution if you use a piece of cloth to clean the lens to prevent scratches. The best way is to remove the dust using special tapes. \r\n\r\n3. Do not place your phone with the camera facing up. If you are in a dusty environment, do not take out your phone. \r\n\r\n4. Keep your phone from hard objects in case the hard objects scratch the camera or even the whole phone body.",
