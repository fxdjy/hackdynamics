  "answer": "**Invisible User Experience **— **Accelerating Your Phone**\r\n\r\n**I. ****Why does my phone get slow?** \r\n\r\n**1. ****Hardware Configuration**\r\n\r\nYour phone performance is determined by the CPU, GPU, and internal storage space. The applications are providing more and more functions. Realizing the functions and effects of the applications consumes many system resources, such as the CPU and internal storage. The phone performance may also be degraded by hardware aging. Reasonably use your phone to prolong its lifespan. \r\n\r\n**2. Applications**\r\n\r\nSome applications automatically start during phone startup and may run in the background, taking up your phone's CPU and internal storage and increasing battery power consumption. \r\n\r\n**II. ****Accelerating your phone**** **\r\n\r\n**1. Prevent applications from automatically starting during startup.**\r\n\r\nThe most effective way of saving up your phone's CPU and internal storage is to forbid applications from starting during startup. \r\n\r\n**2. Monitor and clear exceptions in time, and download applications from trusted sources only. **\r\n\r\nIf your phone fails to run smoothly for a long time, there may be process exceptions that take up the CPU or IO resources. In this case, find out and end the exceptional processes. To view your phone's CPU usage, go to **Settings** > **Developer options**, and select **Show CPU usage**. \r\n\r\nTo monitor and end exceptional processes: \r\n\r\nGo to **Settings** > **Manage apps** > **All**, touch the application in question, and touch **Force stop**. In this way, this application will not automatically start. \r\n\r\nNote: Download applications from trusted sources only, such as Huawei App Center.",
