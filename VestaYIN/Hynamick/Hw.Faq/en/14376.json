  "title": "How is the waterproof and dustproof performance of my B1?",
  "answer": " Your B1 has an IP57 waterproof and dustproof level, preventing dusts from entering your B1 and allowing it to stay in water less than 1 m deep for half an hour. You do not need to take it off when you are washing hands, cooking, or taking a shower. However, you are advised to take it off when you are swimming or diving. \r\n\r\n Found some water drops in your B1? Don't worry. Your B1 remains functional as long as you clean up any water drops found.",
