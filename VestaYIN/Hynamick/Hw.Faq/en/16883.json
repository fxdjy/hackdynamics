  "answer": "l   If the battery power is completely used up:\r\n\r\nIf the battery is over-discharged, the battery will be locked to protect itself. Connect your phone to the charger and wait for a while.\r\n\r\nl   If the battery power is not completely used up:\r\n\r\nUse the original charger provided with your phone. If the charging failure occurs when you use the original charger, replace the USB cable or power socket.\r\n\r\nIf the problem persists, restart your phone and try again.\r\n\r\nl   If your phone is overheating:\r\n\r\nYour phone adopts an over temperature protection design that disables charging if your phone is overheating.\r\n\r\nDo not play games, watch videos, or use other power-intensive applications while charging. It is recommended that you clear background applications from time to time.\r\n\r\nIf the problem persists, contact Huawei technical support or take your phone to an authorized Huawei service center.",
