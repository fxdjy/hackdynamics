  "title": "How do I push contacts on my phone to my B1 in case of coming calls?",
  "answer": " Before you push your contacts to your B1, ensure that the following: \r\n\r\n 1. Your B1 is properly connected to your phone over Bluetooth. \r\n\r\n 2. The Huawei TalkBand app is running properly in the background on your phone.  \r\n Note that most Android phones automatically clear up all background processes. If the Huawei TalkBand app is cleared from the background, your contacts cannot be displayed in your B1 in case of coming calls. It is strongly recommended that you add the Huawei TalkBand background process to the white list in your process clearing tool. \r\n\r\n Some phone operating systems will automatically turn off apps that are running in the background. For Huawei EMUI, to enable the Huawei TalkBand app to run in the background, you need to perform the following steps: choose **Settings** >** Power saving **> **Protected apps**, and then check the **Huawei TalkBand**. \r\n\n![](http://consumer.huawei.com/support/servlet/imageServlet?dlType=HtmlAreaImage&imageId=47353)\n\r\n\r\n For some Android systems, you need to enable the function of accessing contacts for the Huawei TalkBand app in the **Permission manager**. \r\n\n![](http://consumer.huawei.com/support/servlet/imageServlet?dlType=HtmlAreaImage&imageId=47355)\n\r\n\r\n If you are using iPhone, your B1 cannot display your contacts due to the restrictions of the iOS system.",
