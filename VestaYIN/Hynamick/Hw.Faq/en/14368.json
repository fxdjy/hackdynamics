  "title": "How do I connect my B1 to another phone?",
  "answer": " Because your B1 always automatically reconnects the device it has connected to before, you need to perform the following steps if you want to connect your B1 to another phone: \r\n\r\n 1. Turn off Bluetooth in the nearby phones that once connected to your B1, or delete the B1 Bluetooth information on the phones. \r\n\r\n 2. Press and hold the side button for 5 seconds to turn off your B1. Press and hold the button again for 3 seconds to turn it back on. Then the Bluetooth icon starts to blink, indicating that Bluetooth is available now. \r\n\r\n 3. Turn on Bluetooth on the phone you want your B1 to be connected to. The phone will search for and display the nearby Bluetooth devices. Touch **Huawei B1** to connect your B1 to the phone. \r\n\r\n ![](http://consumer.huawei.com/support/servlet/imageServlet?dlType=HtmlAreaImage&imageId=47351)",
