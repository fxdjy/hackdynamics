  "answer": "Your phone will not be locked even if you incorrectly draw the unlock pattern for several consecutive times, but you will have to wait for a while until you can try again.\r\n\r\nIf you forget your unlock pattern, touch the backup PIN button on the screen and enter your backup PIN to unlock the screen.\r\n\r\n[If you forget your unlock pattern and backup PIN, send your phone to Huawei's local customer service center or update your phone version. Your phone cannot be unlocked using an email from Gmail.]()\r\n\n\n\n",
