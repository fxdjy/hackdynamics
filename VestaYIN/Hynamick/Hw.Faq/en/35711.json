  "answer": " You can turn up the volume using the volume up button when music is playing. \r\n\r\n Check whether the phone's speaker has been covered. To ensure normal use, please do not cover the speaker with objects such as phone covers. \r\n\r\n Try playing a ringtone file with the volume turned up to see if there is a problem with the music file. If there is a problem with the file, try again with another file. \r\n\r\n If the problem cannot be solved using the preceding steps, please contact Huawei customer service or take your phone and purchase invoice to a service center for inspection. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
