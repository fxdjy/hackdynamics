  "answer": " Your TalkBand B2 can save data for seven days. \r\n\r\n Sync your TalkBand B2's data to the cloud to ensure it is always backed up. \r\n\r\n Before syncing data, make sure: \r\n\r\n ● You have the latest version of the Huawei Wear application installed. \r\n\r\n ● You have a working Bluetooth connection between your TalkBand B2 and phone. \r\n\r\n ● Both your TalkBand B2 and phone have enough battery power. \r\n\r\n To sync data: \r\n\r\n 1. Open the Huawei Wear application. Select the little man icon in the upper right corner. Touch Log in and then choose a login method. \r\n\r\n 2. Once you have logged in, go to the Huawei Wear screen and swipe downwards to sync data. \r\n\r\n 3. You can sync data from the cloud to other phones by logging in to the same account. \r\n\r\n Note: \r\n\r\n If you switch accounts while using your TalkBand B2, your data will be stored in two accounts. This could lead to some inconsistent records. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
