  "answer": "The possible causes are as follows:  \r\n1、The Bluetooth function of your phone is not turned on.  \r\n      On the main menu screen, select Settings > Wireless & networks, and then select Bluetooth.\r\n\r\n![](http://consumer.huawei.com/resource/Image/1-111115172911.PNG)\r\n\r\n2、The Bluetooth function of your phone is turned on, but your phone is in Hidden mode.  \r\n      On the main menu screen, select Settings > Wireless & networks > Bluetooth settings, and then select Discoverable.\r\n\r\n![](http://consumer.huawei.com/resource/Image/2-111115172920.PNG)\r\n\r\n3、Your phone is using the Wireless Fidelity (WLAN) and Bluetooth functions at the same time.  \r\n      If the Bluetooth function of your phone is turned on but other Bluetooth devices cannot discover your phone, it is recommended that you turn off the WLAN function of your phone first, because the phone uses the same antenna for the WLAN and Bluetooth functions and the two functions may affect each other.",
