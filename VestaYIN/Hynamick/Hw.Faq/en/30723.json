  "title": "The captured image is blurred and the colors are very dark",
  "answer": " Check if there is any dust on the camera lens and try again after cleaning the lens. \r\n\r\n The image will be blurred if the camera did not finish focusing. It takes about 1.5 seconds for the camera to focus; please wait until it has finished focusing before taking a photo. \r\n\r\n Try to avoid taking photos in areas with insufficient light. \r\n\r\n The photo clarity depends on where you take the photo. Please choose a photo mode that suits your surroundings and adjust the camera's parameters. \r\n\r\n If the problem persists, please contact Huawei customer service or take your phone and purchase invoice to a service center for inspection. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
