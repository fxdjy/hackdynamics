  "answer": " A: \r\n\r\n 1.       When E5377Bs-508 using it’s battery power, in order to save energy for longer run-time E5377Bs-508 will lower down its transmit power ,so Wi-Fi signal is weaker compare with powered by USB or power adapter.  Connect E5377Bs-508 to power adapter or with USB cable to a running computer’s USB port will enhance E5377Bs-508’s Wi-Fi signal strength. \r\n\r\n 2.       Keep E5377Bs-508 at least 3 to 6 feet away from other electrical devices which may create RF signal and cause interference (for example, microwave oven, TVs, cordless/cellular phones, baby monitors or wireless speakers).  If you needn’t using any of those devices when you want to connect Internet, please turn it off. \r\n\r\n 3.       In actual use Wi-Fi covered range maybe different from idea square area, it decided by the environment you use.
