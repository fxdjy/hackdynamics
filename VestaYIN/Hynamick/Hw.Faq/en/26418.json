  "answer": "**Reasons Behind Slow Charging**\r\n\r\nIf it is taking longer and longer to fully charge your phone, water may have entered the USB port when you make calls in the rain or when you hold your phone with wet hands. \r\n\r\nIf so, your phone will decrease the charging current from 2 A to 0.5 A. As a result, the charging time is prolonged from three hours to 10 hours or longer. \r\n\r\nIf water enters your phone, make sure the water is wiped completely before you charge your phone. \r\n\r\nSo how can we determine whether water enters the USB port?\r\n\r\nThere is a water-indicating label inside the USB port that becomes red when in contact with water. \r\n\r\nIf the water-indicating label becomes red, dry your phone before charging it. \r\n\r\n![](http://consumer.huawei.com/support/servlet/imageServlet?dlType=SupportImage&imagePath=/20150601211622683001.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe preceding figure shows the USB port without water.\r\n\r\n![](http://consumer.huawei.com/support/servlet/imageServlet?dlType=SupportImage&imagePath=/20150601211622609002.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe preceding figure shows the USB port that has water inside.",
