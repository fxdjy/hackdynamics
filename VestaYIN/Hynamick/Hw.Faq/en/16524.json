  "title": "Why can't my Talkband B1 automatically reconnect to my phone after the Bluetooth connection is terminated?",
  "answer": "Your B1 may disconnect from your phone if they are too faraway from each other. If you bring your B1 back within the range of your phoneBluetooth coverage within 3 minutes, it will automatically reconnect to yourphone if Bluetooth on both devices are still on.  \r\n\nHowever, if thedisconnection lasts for more than 3 minutes, to minimize the energyconsumption, your B1 will automatically turn off Bluetooth and the Bluetoothicon is off. Therefore, after your B1 enters the range of your phone Bluetoothcoverage, you need to press the side button to turn it on, and then your B1will automatically reconnect to your phone.",
