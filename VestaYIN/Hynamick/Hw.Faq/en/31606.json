  "answer": " Use either of the following methods: \r\n\r\n 1. Press the side button to wake up the screen and slide up or down to switch between pages. By default, the home screen is displayed, which shows the time. Slide up or down to check your steps, burnt calories, and sleep statistics. \r\n\r\n 2. Keep the Bluetooth headset screen facing away from you vertical to the ground. Quickly rotate your wrist 90 degrees so the Bluetooth headset'sÂ screen is facing you. Wait for about 1 second for the screen to wake up. If you wake up the screen by rotating your wrist, you can switch between different pages by consecutively rotating your wrist. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
