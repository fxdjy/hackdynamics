  "answer": " Please switch the flash mode to the force flash mode ![](http://consumer.huawei.com/support/servlet/imageServlet?dlType=HtmlAreaImage&imageId=96998). The flash will always come on when capturing images or video. \r\n\r\n When the auto flash mode ![](http://consumer.huawei.com/support/servlet/imageServlet?dlType=HtmlAreaImage&imageId=96999) is enabled, the camera will automatically activate or turn off the flash according to the brightness of the surroundings. If you wish to use the flash in bright areas, please activate the force flash mode. \r\n\r\n Verify that the phone is charging. For some models, the flash cannot be used when the phone is charging. Please disconnect the charger and then see if the flash is functioning normally. \r\n\r\n Check that there is sufficient battery power remaining. \r\n\r\n The system will automatically turn off the flash when the battery level is low in order to prolong the phone's usage time. \r\n\r\n Please charge the phone promptly to ensure normal use. \r\n\r\n When the phone gets too hot or the flash is used too frequently, the flash can overheat and you may not be able to use it. Please try again later. \r\n\r\n If the problem persists, please contact Huawei customer service or take your phone and purchase invoice to a service center for inspection. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
