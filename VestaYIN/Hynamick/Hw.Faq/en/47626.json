  "title": "How do I use the All Focus feature to take a photo?",
  "answer": " The All Focus feature lets you take an image first before selecting the focal point of the photo. \r\n\r\n Go to the camera viewfinder mode and switch to All focus. Ensure that the object you wish to photograph doesn't move, get close to the object, steady your phone and then take a photo. \r\n\r\n When opening photos that were taken in All Focus mode, follow the on-screen prompts to enter edit mode and then touch the area that you want in focus to refocus that image. \r\n\r\n * Only some phone models support the All Focus feature. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
