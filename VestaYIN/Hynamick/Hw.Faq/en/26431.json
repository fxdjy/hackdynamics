  "answer": "**Troubleshooting SIM Card Detection Failures**\r\n\r\nTry the following methods if your phone fails to detect a SIM card. \r\n\r\n**1: Use a standard SIM card. **Read your phone's User Guide to check which type of SIM card it supports. There are mainly three types of SIM cards available: SIM card > micro-SIM card > nano SIM card (ranked by size; from large to small). Do not cut a bigger SIM card into a small one yourself because the card size cannot be accurately controlled, the SIM card chip may be damaged, and your phone may be damaged if inserted with an improperly cut SIM card. If you need a small SIM card, go to your service provider's service center to apply for one. \r\n\r\n**2: Install the SIM card properly. **Read your phone's User Guide to check whether you should insert the SIM card into a card tray or the card socket. Strictly follow the SIM card installation procedure on the User Guide and make sure the SIM card is installed in the correct direction. \r\n\r\n**3: Make sure the SIM card surface is clean without oxidation. **The contact sheet on the SIM card that connects to the SIM card holder is made of metal. If the metal sheet is oxidized or smudged, the SIM card cannot connect to the SIM card holder properly and therefore cannot be detected by your phone. To solve this problem, use a piece of cotton dipped with absolute alcohol to wipe the metal sheet on the SIM card. \r\n\r\n4: Replace the SIM card if it is torn or deformed. If the SIM card is used for a long time, the metal sheet may be torn or deformed, leading to connection failures between the SIM card and card holder and card detection failures. In this case, go to your service provider's service center to apply for a new SIM card. \r\n\r\n**5: Do not reformat your phone yourself. **Some Android phone users like to reformat their phones to try new features but only to find their phones cannot detect SIM cards after being reformatted. \r\n\r\nIf the problem persists after you try the preceding methods, take your phone to the manufacturer's service center.",
