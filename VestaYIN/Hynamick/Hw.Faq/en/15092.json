  "answer": "A: \r\n\r\n1.       When E5336Bs-2&Bs-6 using it’s battery power,  in order to save energy for longer run-time E5336Bs-2&Bs-6 will lower down its transmit power ,so Wi-Fi signal is weaker compare with powered by USB or power adapter.  Connect E5336Bs-2&Bs-6 to power adapter or with USB cable to a running computer’s USB port will enhance E5336Bs-2&Bs-6’s Wi-Fi signal strength.\r\n\r\n2.       Keep E5336Bs-2&Bs-6 at least 3 to 6 feet away from other electrical devices which may create RF signal and cause interference (for example, microwave oven, TVs, cordless/cellular phones, baby monitors or wireless speakers).  If you needn’t using any of those devices when you want to connect Internet, please turn it off.\r\n\r\n3.       Wi-Fi covered range of E5336Bs-2&Bs-6 is according to its power supply mode and its using environment. In Idea clear square area the Wi-Fi covered range of E5336Bs-2&Bs-6 showed below:\r\n\r\nUse power adapter: 100m (328ft)\r\n\r\nUse USB cable connect: 20m (66ft)\r\n\r\nUse battery supply: 10m (33ft)\r\n\r\n4.       In actual use Wi-Fi covered range maybe different from idea square area, it decided by the environment you use. The closer to E5336Bs-2&Bs-6, the stronger Wi-Fi signal you get. And every obstacle (walls, ceilings, furniture) between your device and E5336Bs-2&Bs-6 may decrease Wi-Fi signal strength. Move your device closer to E5336Bs-2&Bs-6 can avoid obstacles and improve Wi-Fi signal.\r\n\r\n3.       Change the Wi-Fi channel to fix one other than auto (you can try the available channel one by one and select the channel with best signal strength)",
