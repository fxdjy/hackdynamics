  "answer": " If you think the screen wakeup by wrist rotation feature does not work properly, try the following: Wear the TalkBand B2 and keep your wrist level. Keep the Bluetooth headset screen facing away from you vertical to the ground. Quickly rotate your wrist 90 degrees so the Bluetooth headset's screen is facing you. Wait for about 1 second for the screen to wake up. You may need to try this motion a few times to find an optimal rotation speed. \r\n\r\n If you wake up the screen by rotating your wrist, you can switch between different pages by consecutively rotating your wrist. Adjust the strap when you wear the TalkBand B2 to enable the screen wakeup by wrist rotation feature to work properly. \r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n",
