  "answer": "The battery lasts for about one and a half to two days with normal usage. This includes 24 hours of heavy usage with the screen on and 8 hours of screen-off time (in sleep mode).\r\n\r\nThe watch can complete the following typical tasks in a 24-hour period on a single charge:\r\n\r\n*   View the time: 6 times/hour\r\n*   Receive push notifications: 20 times/hour\r\n*   Send tasks to phone: 5 times/hour\r\n*   Decline calls: 15 times\r\n*   Answer calls: 30 times\r\n*   The phone stays in standby mode for the remainder of the 24-hour period (screen on)![](http://app.huawei.com/tkb/ha-i/733bd_ka8m2.gif) NOTE: \r\n\r\nThe battery life may vary significantly depending on how you use your watch.
