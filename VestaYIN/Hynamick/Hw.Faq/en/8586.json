  "answer": " Your phone features a proximity sensor next to the earpiece. \r\n\r\n When your ear or other object is near the proximity sensor, the screen automatically turns off. The screen turns back on when the object near the proximity sensor is removed. \r\n\r\n If the screen is still off after you take the phone away from your ear, check if the area around the sensor is being covered by another object.****",
