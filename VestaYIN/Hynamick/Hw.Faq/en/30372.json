  "title": "The call ringtone automatically reverts to the default ringtone",
  "answer": " If the configured ringtone is not a preloaded ringtone, please check whether the ringtone file was moved or deleted. Please reset the ringtone. \r\n\r\n If the phone supports an external microSD card and the configured ringtone is saved on the microSD card, the call ringtone will be restored to the default ringtone after the phone is connected to a computer and USB mode is activated. The ringtone will revert to the configured ringtone when the phone is disconnected. You can also move the ringtone file to the internal storage and then change the ringtone settings. \r\n\r\n If the phone supports an external microSD card and the configured ringtone is saved on the microSD card, please check whether the microSD card was unmounted. Please remount the microSD card and reset the ringtone settings. \r\n\r\n If the problem persists, please contact Huawei customer service or take your phone and purchase invoice to a service center for inspection. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
