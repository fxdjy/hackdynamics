Streaming video sites such as YouTube will use very large amounts of data and this may be causing it. It could also be that your computer is automatically downloading updates for your Operating System and for other programs you may have installed. To stop this please make sure that Automatic updates are set to prompt you to download, instead of automatically downloading all updates. You should check this setting for any security software you may have as well as these often automatically update as well.","faqTypeId":null,"faqType":null,"useful":0,"unUseful":1,"languageId":1,"languageName":"en","faqCode":"5110","faqTypeCode":null,"isTop":"0","moduleCode":"faq","productId":null,"productCode":null,"postDate":1264822930000,"seriesProductName":"","visitedTimes":77,"isUsefulFlag":null,"score":0,"times":0,"imageList":null,"displayType":"text","justView":"0","fileName":null,"filePath":null,"imagePath":null,"imageName":null,"productIdList":null,"curPage":null,"pageSize":null,"siteCode":null,"statusFlag":"Publish","returnCode":0,"totalRows":null,"keywords":null,"avgScore":0.0,"createDate":null,"totalPages":null}
