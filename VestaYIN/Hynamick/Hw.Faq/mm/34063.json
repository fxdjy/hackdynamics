  "answer": " Change the Wi-Fi sleep policy as follows: \r\n\r\n Touch Settings > Wireless & networks > Wi-Fi. Then touch Advanced settings > Keep Wi-Fi on during sleep, and select Always. \r\n\r\n Note: By default, Always is selected for Keep Wi-Fi on during sleep. If the settings are modified, your phone disconnects from the Wi-Fi network when its screen turns off. The following describes the three options of Keep Wi-Fi on during sleep: \r\n\r\n Always: Never disconnect a Wi-Fi connection. \r\n\r\n Only when plugged in: The Wi-Fi connection never disconnects when the phone is charging. If the phone is not charging, it disconnects a Wi-Fi connection when it has been idle for 3 minutes. \r\n\r\n [[Never (increase data usage): The Wi-Fi connection disconnects when the phone has been idle for 3 minutes.]()]() \r\n\n\n\n\n",
