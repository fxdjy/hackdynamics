  "answer": " 1. Calls made in hand-held mode use the main microphone on the bottom right of your phone. Make sure that when you are making calls your hand does not cover the microphone hole. \r\n\r\n 1. When making calls in hand-held mode, your phone uses dual-microphone noise reduction technology to improve call clarity. In order to improve your in-call experience, your phone may treat sounds that are relatively far from the main microphone as noise and automatically filter them out. Because of this, try to maintain a normal distance from the phone (within 10 cm from the main microphone) when making calls. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
