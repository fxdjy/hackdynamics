  "title": "How is my phone's internal memory divided?",
  "answer": " Phones, computers, tablets, and other devices are set up in a similar way. Physical ROM and RAM portions are all the same as described in the product specifications. However, the system may take up part of this memory. \r\n\r\n System applications, files, database information, and more all use memory on your phone, in total about 6 GB. The space taken up by these things is not displayed to you by your phone. \r\n\r\n Specific phones, like 16 GB phones, show about 9 GB of available memory. 32 GB phones show about 26 GB of available memory. 64 GB phones show about 52 GB of available memory. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
