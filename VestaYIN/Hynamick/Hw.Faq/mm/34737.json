  "title": " I cannot open web pages sometimes over a WLAN connection. Why?",
  "answer": " Possible causes are as follows: \r\n\r\n The x digital subscriber line (xDSL) connection failed. If the hotspot (such as a wireless router) your phone connects to accesses the Internet through xDSL and the xDSL connection fails, the Internet connection is unavailable. \r\n\r\n A domain name service (DNS) problem occurred. For example, if you cannot open web pages but can access Play Store, the DNS is not working properly. In this case, on the screen where a static IP address can be set, modify DNS settings. \r\n\r\n The WLAN hotspot is working in the access restricted state. If the Internet connection of the hotspot is restricted, your phone cannot be used to browse web pages. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
