  "title": " How do I use my phone as a USB flash drive?",
  "answer": " You can connect your phone to a computer using a USB cable to view content in the microSD card but not the internal storage. \r\n\r\n Media device (MTP): MTP stands for Media Transfer Protocol. In this mode, you can synchronize media files between your phone and a computer that supports MTP. \r\n\r\n USB flash drive mode: If a microSD card is inserted into your phone, you can use your phone as a USB flash drive and transfer files between your microSD card and computer. \r\n\r\n PC Suite (HiSuite): In this mode, you can use HiSuite on your computer to manage photos, songs, messages, contacts, and applications on your phone. \r\n\r\n Charge only: In this mode, you can use a computer to charge your phone. \r\n\r\n [Note: When your phone is connected to a Mac in MTP mode, you can manage files on your phone, but the dial-up connection function on the Mac is currently unavailable.]() \r\n\n\n\n\n",
