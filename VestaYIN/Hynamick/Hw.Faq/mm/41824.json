  "title": "What can I do if third party apps are unable to determine my actual location?",
  "answer": " If your phone cannot find any GPS satellites, third party apps will determine your location using third party servers. Errors may occur when determining your location in this way. Inaccuracies of about 100 meters are normal. It is recommended that you use navigation functions when outside and check whether this improves the accuracy of the location found. \r\n\r\n Try to following things to improve accuracy when determining your location: \r\n\r\n 1. Chang the mode for determining location to High accuracy. (Go to Settings > Location access > Location mode \r\n\r\n 1. Try going to an open area and trying to determine your location again. \r\n\r\n 1. Turn on Wi-Fi and try again. \r\n\r\n 1. Third party apps determine locations using the internet. If you are near a national border your location may not be determined accurately. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
