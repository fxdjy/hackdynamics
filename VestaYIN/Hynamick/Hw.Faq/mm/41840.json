  "answer": " Make sure the four metal sections on the headset plug are completely inserted into the headset plug opening. When the last section is plugged in there may be a popping sound as the plug is inserted into position. When the headset is completely plugged in, check if the sound is normal. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
