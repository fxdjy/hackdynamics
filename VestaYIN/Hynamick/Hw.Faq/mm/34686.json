  "title": " What Services does my phone support?",
  "answer": " Your phone is a single-card multimode CSFB phone. Use of voice or data services depends on the type of card you install and the preset mode of your phone. \r\n\r\n If a USIM card is installed, your phone can connect to a LTE/WCDMA/GSM network. If a SIM card is installed, your phone can connect to a WCDMA/GSM network. \r\n\r\n Your phone chooses the LTE, WCDMA, and GSM in order of decreasing priority upon power-on. \r\n\r\n Your phone registers with the LTE network in idle state. If leaving the LTE network, your phone registers with the WCDMA and GSM/GPRS/EDGE network. \r\n\r\n You can set the preferred network mode to reduce power consumption and improve the standby time. \r\n\r\n It is recommended that you subscribe to services such as missed-call reminder from your service provider to avoid inconvenience caused by missed calls. \r\n\r\n ![](http://consumer.huawei.com/support/servlet/imageServlet?dlType=HtmlAreaImage&imageId=110535) ![](http://consumer.huawei.com/support/servlet/imageServlet?dlType=HtmlAreaImage&imageId=110536) ![](http://consumer.huawei.com/support/servlet/imageServlet?dlType=HtmlAreaImage&imageId=110537)\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n",
