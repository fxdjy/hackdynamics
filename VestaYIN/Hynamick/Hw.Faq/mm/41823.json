  "title": "What can I do if third party map applications cannot load map images?",
  "answer": " 1. Check whether you have a good network connection. If the network is relatively slow, this can prevent images from loading. Try using Wi-Fi to download an offline map package. \r\n\r\n 1. Try removing the microSD card and checking whether the map data can be loaded. Android 4.4 and later versions require third party apps to have read/write permissions for the microSD card. Some apps may not have this permission, resulting in not being able to download the map data to the microSD card. \r\n\r\n 1. If you have a dual SIM card phone, go to Dual card management, and confirm that Default mobile data and Default calls/messages are set to the same SIM card. \r\n\r\n 1. Try to avoid using map applications when your phone is connected to a 2G network. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
