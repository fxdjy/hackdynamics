  "title": "When I take my phone from a dark to bright environment and answer a call, why does the screen respond comparatively slowly?",
  "answer": " This is due to a change in Google Android 5.0 and later, which improved the stability of screen brightness. Huawei will continue to improve this issue in later versions. Please regularly check for system updates. \r\n\r\n You can also try buying a leather case. After opening the leather case's cover, your phone's screen brightness will match the environment faster. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
