  "answer": " Your phone supports third-party applications in APK format only. Make sure the application you are trying to install is in this format. \r\n\r\n If the application is not from the Play Store, you need to set your phone to trust the application source. Go to Settings > Security. Touch Unknown sources. Then, install the application again. \r\n\r\n The third-party application may not be compatible with your phone. Try similar applications compatible with your phone. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
