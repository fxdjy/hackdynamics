  "answer": " By adjusting the color saturation rate slightly higher, your phone makes your photos look even better. The color saturation rate of your phone has been optimized based on research and field studies. We compared the color performance of your phone with the iPhone 6 in a number of scenarios. Your phone came out on top, especially for outdoor shots or photos taken in shopping malls or restaurants where the color temperature is low. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
