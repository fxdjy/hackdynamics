  "answer": " Your phone will not be locked even if you incorrectly draw the unlock pattern several consecutive times, but you will have to wait for a while until you can try again. \r\n\r\n If you forget your unlock pattern, touch the backup password button on the screen and enter your backup password to unlock the screen. \r\n\r\n [If you forget your unlock pattern, please send your phone to the local customer service center. Your phone cannot be unlocked using an email from Gmail.]() \r\n\n\n\n\n",
