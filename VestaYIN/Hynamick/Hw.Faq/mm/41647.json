  "answer": " Make sure the Double touch switch is turned on in Settings > Motion control > Double touch. If it is turned on, make sure you double touch correctly according. Note the following: \r\n\r\n  The area within 1 cm from the edge of the screen does not recognize touches. \r\n\r\n  The interval between touches must not exceed 500 ms. \r\n\r\n  The distance between touches must not exceed 5 mm. \r\n\r\n  Don't try to turn on the screen in this way immediately after locking the screen. The screen only recognizes your touches 800 ms after turning off. \r\n\r\n  When double touching, make sure not to block the light sensor. If you block or touch near the light sensor, your touches will not be recognized. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
