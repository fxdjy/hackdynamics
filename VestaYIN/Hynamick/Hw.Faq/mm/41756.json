  "title": "How do I use the headset provided with my phone to control the music player?",
  "answer": " Your phone supports the headset with three buttons and Smart headset control and provides the following control modes: \r\n\r\n 1. Press the headset button in the middle to play songs or stop playing songs. \r\n\r\n 2. Double-press the headset button in the middle to play the next song. \r\n\r\n 3. Press the headset button in the middle consecutively for three times to play the previous song. \r\n\r\n 4. Press the volume up button on your phone to increase the volume. \r\n\r\n 5. Double-press the volume up button on your phone to add the current song to Favorites or remove it from Favorites. \r\n\r\n 6. Press the volume down button on your phone to lower the volume. \r\n\r\n 7. Double-press the volume down button on your phone to change the playback sequence. \r\n\r\n If Smart headset control is not enabled, you can only perform 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. \r\n\r\n ![](http://consumer.huawei.com/support/servlet/imageServlet?dlType=HtmlAreaImage&imageId=140381)\r\n\r\n It is recommended that you use the headset provided with your phone. The headsets of other brands may not be compatible with your phone, resulting in a failure to control the music player. If you install other music players than Huawei Music on your phone, you may not be able to control the music player by using the headset. For details, contact the application developer. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
