  "answer": " Change the Wi-Fi sleep policy as follows: Touch Settings, go to the Wireless & networks > Wi-Fi. Touch Advanced settings > Keep Wi-Fi on during sleep, and select Always. \r\n\r\n Note: By default, Always is selected for Keep Wi-Fi on during sleep. If the settings are modified, your phone disconnects from the Wi-Fi network when its screen turns off. The following describes the three options of Keep Wi-Fi on during sleep: \r\n\r\n Always: The Wi-Fi connection never disconnects. \r\n\r\n Only when plugged in: The Wi-Fi connection never disconnects when the phone is charging. If the phone is not charging, it disconnects a Wi-Fi connection when it has been idle for 3 minutes. \r\n\r\n [<a name=\"_Toc387919016\">Never (increase data usage): The Wi-Fi connection disconnects when the phone has been idle for 3 minutes.</a>]() \r\n\n\n\n\n",
