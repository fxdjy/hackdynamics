  "title": " Sometimes I cannot open web pages over a Wi-Fi connection. Why?",
  "answer": " Possible causes are as follows: \r\n\r\n The x digital subscriber line (xDSL) connection failed. If the hotspot (such as a wireless router) your phone connects to accesses the Internet through xDSL and the xDSL connection fails, the Internet connection is unavailable. Check that the xDSL connection is working properly and try again. \r\n\r\n A domain name service (DNS) problem occurred. For example, if you cannot open web pages but can access App Center, the DNS is not working properly. In this case, on the screen where a static IP address can be set, modify DNS settings. \r\n\r\n [The websites that the Wi-Fi hotspot can access are restricted. In this case, your phone cannot be used to browse web pages at those websites.]() \r\n\n\n\n\n",
