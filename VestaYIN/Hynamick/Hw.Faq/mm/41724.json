  "title": "What is fingerprint identification?",
  "answer": " The fingerprint identification is a highlight of your phone. It enhances the information security of your phone and provides shortcut operations. When you power on your phone for the first time, you can follow the onscreen instructions to configure the fingerprint identification. \r\n\r\n The fingerprint identification includes the Touch control and the Fingerprint ID. \r\n\r\n Touch control: You can touch, touch and hold, and swipe on the fingerprint sensor to operate your phone without entering your fingerprint. You can answer calls, take photos, record videos, stop alarms, and open the notification panel using the fingerprint sensor. \r\n\r\n Fingerprint ID: You can unlock the screen, access the safe, and access the App lock by entering your fingerprint instead of the password. You can also use it on third-party applications that support the fingerprint identification. You need to enable the PIN unlock or mixed password unlock for the fingerprint identification. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
