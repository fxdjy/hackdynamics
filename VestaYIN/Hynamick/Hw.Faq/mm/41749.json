  "answer": " [To guarantee the supply of phone components, Huawei usually cooperates with at least two suppliers to produce phone cameras of the same specification. The rear camera module of the Rio is provided by two suppliers: Sunny and Lite-on. Cameras produced by these two main suppliers are of the same specification. It is very common in the industry that a company cooperates with multiple suppliers to guarantee the product supply. The technology for producing rear cameras is very complicated. To ensure the supply, Huawei needs to cooperate with at least two sensor suppliers.]() \r\n\n\n\n\n",
