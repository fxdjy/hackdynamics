  "answer": " This problem is caused by the sleep policy. On the home screen, touch Settings > Wi-Fi. Touch the menu key and touch Advanced Wi-Fi > Keep Wi-Fi on during sleep > Always. \r\n\r\n ![](http://consumer.huawei.com/support/servlet/imageServlet?dlType=HtmlAreaImage&imageId=110590) ![](http://consumer.huawei.com/support/servlet/imageServlet?dlType=HtmlAreaImage&imageId=110591)\r\n\r\n ![](http://consumer.huawei.com/support/servlet/imageServlet?dlType=HtmlAreaImage&imageId=110592)\r\n\r\n By default, Always is selected. If you change the sleep policy, Wi-Fi disconnects when the screen times out. The implication of each option is given as below: \r\n\r\n Always: The WLAN connection is always kept. \r\n\r\n Only when plugged in: The WLAN connection is kept only when the phone is charged. WLAN disconnects in 3 minutes after the screen times out if the phone is not charged. \r\n\r\n Never (increases data usage): WLAN disconnects in 3 minutes after the screen times out. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
