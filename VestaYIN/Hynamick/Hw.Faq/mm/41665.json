  "answer": " TalkBack is an accessibility service designed for visually retarded users. When Explore by Touch under TalkBack settings is turned on, you can hear or see descriptions of what's under your finger or perform gestures to interact with the tablet. For example, to open Settings, touch the Settings icon and double-touch anywhere on the screen to open it. Two fingers are required for the slide gesture. \r\n\r\n To enable TalkBack, go to Settings > Accessibility > TalkBack and turn on TalkBack. \r\n\r\n To disable TalkBack, turn off the TalkBack switch, double-touch anywhere on the screen, touch OK when prompted, and double-touch anywhere on the screen again. \r\n\r\n ![](http://consumer.huawei.com/support/servlet/imageServlet?dlType=HtmlAreaImage&imageId=140253)\r\n\r\n TalkBack does not support Chinese currently. When the system language is English and TalkBack is enabled, there are English voice instructions for operations. When the system language is Chinese and TalkBack is enabled, there is only alert tone for operations. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
