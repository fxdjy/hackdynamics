  "answer": " This problem is sleep strategy. Method to enter: On the home screen, click Settings > Wi-Fi, and then click the menu button ![](http://consumer.huawei.com/support/servlet/imageServlet?dlType=HtmlAreaImage&imageId=110006)and enter Advanced > Maintain Wi-Fi connection in sleep status, set it to \"Always\". \r\n\r\n ![](http://consumer.huawei.com/support/servlet/imageServlet?dlType=HtmlAreaImage&imageId=110007) ![](http://consumer.huawei.com/support/servlet/imageServlet?dlType=HtmlAreaImage&imageId=110008)\r\n\r\n Note: The default setting is Always on the phone, which means the phone is always connected properly. If you adjust the sleep strategy, the phone will automatically disconnect in standby status. The meaning of three options is as follows: \r\n\r\n Always: Always keep the Wi-Fi connection. \r\n\r\n Only for the charging time: Only when the phone is being charged can it remain connected, if not, it will disconnect after 3 minutes in standby. \r\n\r\n Never (which will increase data network traffic): disconnect in 3 minutes after entering standby status. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
