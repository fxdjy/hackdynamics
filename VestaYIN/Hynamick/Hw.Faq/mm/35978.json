  "answer": " Yes. You can connect your phone to a computer using a USB cable. In mass storage mode, you can view only content in the microSD card. Files in the phone's internal storage are not displayed. \r\n\r\n Media device (MTP): MTP stands for Media Transfer Protocol. In this mode, you can synchronize media files between your phone and the computer that support MTP. \r\n\r\n HiSuite: In this mode, the computer starts HiSuite, with which you can manage pictures, songs, messages, contacts, and applications on your phone. \r\n\r\n ![](http://consumer.huawei.com/support/servlet/imageServlet?dlType=HtmlAreaImage&imageId=113097)\r\n\r\n When your phone is connected to a Mac in MTP mode, you can manage files on your phone, but the dial-up connection function on the Mac is unavailable. \r\n\r\n ![](http://consumer.huawei.com/support/servlet/imageServlet?dlType=HtmlAreaImage&imageId=113098) ![](http://consumer.huawei.com/support/servlet/imageServlet?dlType=HtmlAreaImage&imageId=113099)\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n",
