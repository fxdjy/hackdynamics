  "answer": " 1. Make sure that GPS is turned on. Turn on high accuracy location mode to use GPS, Wi-Fi, and mobile data together to determine your location. (Go to Settings > Location access to turn on the options.) \r\n\r\n 1. Make sure the offline map data has been completely downloaded. Try turning on mobile data (if mobile data is unavailable, use a Wi-Fi network instead), searching for the destination location, finding a good route, turning off your mobile data, and then using offline navigation. \r\n\r\n 1. When you are in tunnels, the navigation icon will disappear because in tunnels you cannot find any satellites. Once you exit the tunnel and drive to a more open area, start using navigation again. \r\n\r\n 1. Make sure your phone has enough power and it is relatively cool when you use the navigation function. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
