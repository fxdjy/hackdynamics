  "title": "What can I do if my phone's GPS function finds satellites slowly or cannot find any satellites?",
  "answer": " 1. Do not search for GPS satellites underground or in enclosed spaces (for example, on the first floor of tall buildings, in areas where there is little space between tall buildings, in underground parking garages, and so on). In such places, the chance of finding satellites is low. \r\n\r\n 1. Turning on mobile data may help your phone determine your location more quickly. \r\n\r\n 1. Try not to touch the upper right corner of your phone. The GPS antenna is in that area. \r\n\r\n 1. Check whether you are using a metal case. Metal cases can interfere with your phone's antennas, potentially degrading your phoneâ€™s signal strength. It is recommended that you use plastic or leather cases. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
