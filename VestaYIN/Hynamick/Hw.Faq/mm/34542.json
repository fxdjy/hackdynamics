  "answer": " 1. If there are many programs running, you can close some programs running in the background. On the home screen, click Settings > Apps > Running, and select the application and then select Stop. \r\n\r\n 2. Too many applications and insufficient system disk space may cause the phone to run slowly, in this case, you can uninstall some applications to free up the space on the system disk and increase the memory. \r\n\r\n 3. If the CPU occupancy is high and many background processes are running, the phone will get stuck in operation. In this case, you can restart the phone, and the unused background processes and applications will be closed. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
