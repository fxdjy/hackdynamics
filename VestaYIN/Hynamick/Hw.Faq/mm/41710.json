  "title": "Why is there noise and intermittence when I have calls or listen to the music using the Bluetooth headset?",
  "answer": " Check whether the problem persists in all conditions. If yes, check whether the Bluetooth headset is compatible with your phone and whether it is compatible with other phones. \r\n\r\n If the problem occurs in certain conditions, for example, when you put the phone in your pocket, in a backpack, on a table, or hold it in your hand, it may be because the antenna is shielded. The Bluetooth antenna of your phone is at the top of the phone. When it is shielded or blocked, the signal reception will be affected. \r\n\r\n Keep the antenna at the back of the phone unshielded. Don't put your phone close to your skin or on a metal table. \r\n\r\n If the Bluetooth headset is not close to your phone or is blocked from your phone by a wall, the signal will decrease. \r\n\r\n Make sure your phone's protective cover is made of plastics or leather instead of metal, because a metallic protective cover will block your phone's antenna signal. \r\n\r\n Check whether you have a download task over the Wi-Fi. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
