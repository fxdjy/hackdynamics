  "answer": " After inserting and removing SIM cards multiple times, the metal on the connector pins may wear down. Wear on the pins and the connections between the pins can result in SIM cards not being recognized by phones. Try using a small knife to scratch the connector pins and the connections between the pins and then re-insert the SIM card to see whether it can be recognized. \r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n",
