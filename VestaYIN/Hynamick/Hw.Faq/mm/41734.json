  "answer": " If your phone is locked with its screen on, your phone will vibrate when unsuccessful fingerprint unlock occurs and display a message indicating that the fingerprint unlock fails. If the fingerprint unlock fails consecutively for three times, an onscreen keyboard will be displayed. You can unlock the screen using the password. If the fingerprint unlock fails consecutively for six times, a message indicating that you can try again 30s later will be displayed. You can also enter the password to unlock the screen. \r\n\r\n If your phone is locked with its screen off, the phone will vibrate but the screen will not be turned on when unsuccessful fingerprint unlock occurs. You can try the fingerprint unlock up to 30 times. If you still fail to unlock the screen, the screen will be turned on and a message indicating that you can try again 30s later will be displayed on the screen. You can also enter the password on the onscreen keyboard to access your phone. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
