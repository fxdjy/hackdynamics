  "title": " Sometimes, web pages cannot be opened via Wi-Fi connection",
  "answer": " The causes are as follows: \r\n\r\n1XDSL dial failure. In the connection of hotspots (for example, wireless router), use XDSL to connect to the Internet, and if XDSL dialing fails, Internet access will become impossible. Do try again after successful XDSL dialing. \r\n\r\n2Problem with DNS name resolution. If you cannot open the page but can log in to google apps, this indicates a problem with DNS resolution. (Verify if the DNS can be configured). \r\n\r\n3Wi-Fi hotspot access restrictions. If the currently connected hotspot itself is in the access-restricted state, the phone will not be able to access web pages. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
