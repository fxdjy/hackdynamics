  "answer": " This is because Magnification gestures has been enabled. When the screen is touched three times in succession, magnification gestures are triggered. Once they are triggered, you need to touch the screen with two fingers at the same time in order to move around on the zoomed-in screen. You can also touch the screen three times in succession again to return to normal. \r\n\r\n The magnification gestures feature is to allow visually impaired people to use a phone. If you don't need this feature, go to Settings > Accessibility > Magnification gestures and turn it off. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
