  "answer": " Your phone will not be locked even if you incorrectly draw the unlock pattern for several consecutive times, but you will have to wait for a while until you can try again. \r\n\r\n [If you forget your unlock pattern, please send your phone to the local customer service center or update your phone version. Your phone cannot be unlocked using an email from Gmail.]() \r\n\n\n\n\n",
