  "title": " Does my phone support dual SIM cards?",
  "answer": " Your phone supports dual card dual standby single pass, which means you cannot use both SIM cards for calls or data services simultaneously.(Notes:The device must support dual card.) \r\n\r\n When you are on a call using SIM card 1, SIM card 2 cannot be used to make or answer calls. If someone calls SIM card 2, the caller will hear a voice message like \"The subscriber you dialed is out of the service zone\" or \"The subscriber you dialed is not able to answer your call, please try again later.\" \r\n\r\n When you are using SIM card 1's data service, SIM card 2's data service will be disabled. \r\n\r\n Your phone's single pass feature helps reduce power consumption and increase your phone's standby time. \r\n\r\n It may help to contact your service provider and subscribe to missed call reminder and related assistance services to ensure you never miss a thing. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
