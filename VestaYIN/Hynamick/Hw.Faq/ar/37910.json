  "title": "GPS location is inaccurate",
  "answer": " Location accuracy depends on the accuracy of GPS satellites and mapping software. Please use the GPS in open spaces where signal is stronger, for example, on the street or in open plazas. GPS signal is weak indoors. Positioning may be inaccurate or could fail altogether. \r\n\r\n For more accurate GPS positioning, go to Settings, select Location access and then select positioning assistance methods such as Wi-Fi, mobile data or A-GPS. \r\n\r\n If you are still unable to determine your location after attempting the preceding steps, please try again with a different navigation app. \r\n\r\n If the problem persists, please contact Huawei customer service or take your phone and purchase invoice to a service center for inspection. \r\n\n\n\n\n",
