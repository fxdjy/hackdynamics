If your phone comes with Phone Manager preloaded, please follow these instructions to free up memory: \r\n\r\n For EMUI 2.0 and EMUI 2.3, open Phone Manager, select Storage cleaner and then follow the on-screen instructions to clean up your phone. \r\n\r\n For EMUI 3.0, open Phone Manager, select Phone accelerator > Storage cleaner and then follow the on-screen instructions to clean up your phone. \r\n\r\n Some third-party apps have poor compatibility and may conflict with the phone's operating system.
