  "answer": " Point the lens at the object that you want to photograph. The camera will focus automatically; you can also touch the screen to focus manually. It takes about 1.5 seconds for the camera to focus. Please wait until the camera has finished focusing before taking a photo. \r\n\r\n If the focus frame turns red, this means that the camera failed to focus. Please move the lens and focus again.\n",
