{"type":null,"faqId":5549,"title":"Why can my  data card only be used in 2G networks?","answer":"Step 1 Choose Tools > Options to open the Options interface.\nStep 2 Set Network Type to WCDMA only and click Apply. About one minute later, you can\naccess 3G networks.\nStep 3 If you still cannot access 3G networks after 3G only is selected, the APN may be incorrectly\nset. Contact the local carrier.\nIf the problem persists when the APN is correctly set and 3G only is selected, use a 3G\nmobile phone to test whether the local area is covered by 3G networks. If the 3G mobile\nphone cannot access 3G networks, you can infer that the problem must be related to the\nnetwork.","faqTypeId":null,"faqType":null,"useful":0,"unUseful":0,"languageId":1,"languageName":"en","faqCode":"5549","faqTypeCode":null,"isTop":"0","moduleCode":"faq","productId":null,"productCode":null,"postDate":1264836153000,"seriesProductName":"","visitedTimes":13,"isUsefulFlag":null,"score":0,"times":0,"imageList":null,"displayType":"text","justView":"0","fileName":null,"filePath":null,"imagePath":null,"imageName":null,"productIdList":null,"curPage":null,"pageSize":null,"siteCode":null,"statusFlag":"Publish","returnCode":0,"totalRows":null,"keywords":null,"avgScore":0.0,"createDate":null,"totalPages":null}
