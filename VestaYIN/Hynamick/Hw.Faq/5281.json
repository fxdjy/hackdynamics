{"type":null,"faqId":5281,"title":"Question 15: Why the throughput of WLAN is extremely  low while enabling the WLAN service of HG?","answer":"(1) The transmission medium of WLAN is different from that of Ethernet. If there are lots of WLAN exist in present location, especially when lots of WLAN concentrate in one channel, channels of the network will disturb each other, and these will result in low throughput in WLAN.\n(2) Sometimes the throughput of the network card which supports 802.11g will decline to half of the normal value (11Mbps). This is mostly because that there are other WLAN or network cards which supports 802.11b exist in the wireless converge area of HG. When the network 802.11b and 802.11g all exist, the condition that HG enable both 802.11b and 802.11g in the same time will result in throughput declines sharply. The throughput will resume in a few minutes after the jam source which supports 802.11b is off.\n(3) When there is a far distance or there are too many shields between the computer and HG, throughput will be influenced because that the signal strength has been influenced. And while we test the throughput, please donâ€™t move HG or the network card because changing the relative position will result in the decline of throughput and sometimes this even leads to the interrupt of the connection.\n","faqTypeId":null,"faqType":null,"useful":0,"unUseful":0,"languageId":1,"languageName":"en","faqCode":"5281","faqTypeCode":null,"isTop":"0","moduleCode":"faq","productId":null,"productCode":null,"postDate":1264831975000,"seriesProductName":"","visitedTimes":32,"isUsefulFlag":null,"score":0,"times":0,"imageList":null,"displayType":"text","justView":"0","fileName":null,"filePath":null,"imagePath":null,"imageName":null,"productIdList":null,"curPage":null,"pageSize":null,"siteCode":null,"statusFlag":"Publish","returnCode":0,"totalRows":null,"keywords":null,"avgScore":0.0,"createDate":null,"totalPages":null}
