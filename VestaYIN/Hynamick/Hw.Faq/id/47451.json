  "answer": "Make sure the **Double touch** switch is turned on in **Settings** > **Motion control** > **Double touch**. If it is turned on, make sure you double touch correctly according. Note the following:\r\n\r\nl   The area within 1 cm from the edge of the screen does not recognize touches.\r\n\r\nl   The interval between touches must not exceed 500 ms.\r\n\r\nl   The distance between touches must not exceed 5 mm.\r\n\r\nl   Don't try to turn on the screen in this way immediately after locking the screen. The screen only recognizes your touches 800 ms after turning off.\r\n\r\nl   When double touching, make sure not to block the light sensor. If you block or touch near the light sensor, your touches will not be recognized.",
