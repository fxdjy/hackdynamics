  "title": "Why is the data connection on one of the SIM cards very slow?",
  "answer": "When both SIM cards in your phone are 3G or 4G SIM cards, only one of them has access to 3G or 4G networks and the other one has access to 2G networks. In addition, the phone can use only one SIM card to access the Internet. \r\n\r\nYou can go to **Settings ** > **All ** > **Wireless & networks ** > **Dual card management ** and switch 4G/3G slot and mobile data. \r\n\r\n ![](http://consumer.huawei.com/support/servlet/imageServlet?dlType=SupportImage&imagePath=/20151019112511553001.png) \r\n\r\nIf you select **4G/3G slot ** for SIM card 1 and **Default mobile data ** for SIM card 2, card 2 accesses the Internet through a 2G network, in which case the data connection is relatively slow. \r\n\r\n ![](http://consumer.huawei.com/support/servlet/imageServlet?dlType=SupportImage&imagePath=/20151019112539816001.png)   \r\n\r\nYou can select both **Default mobile data ** and **4G/3G slot ** for one card. Then this card can access the Internet through a 3G or 4G network. \r\n\r\nIf the data connection is slow when using a 3G or 4G SIM card, check the signal reception of your phone. \r\n\r\nThe preceding operations may consume a large amount of traffic. It is recommended that you disable the mobile data service when you're not using it.",
