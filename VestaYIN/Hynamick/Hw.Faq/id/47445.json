  "title": "What can I do if, after I insert a SIM card, my phone doesn't recognize it?",
  "answer": "1.         You can only use standard nano-SIM cards. If you do not have a standard SIM card, save the contact information on the card and go to your carrier's service center to get a standard SIM card. Hand-cut SIM cards may not be recognized by your phone and may damage the card slot. If you use a hand-cut nano-SIM card, after cutting the card, make sure you polish the metal edges smooth before using.\r\n\r\n2.         Make sure the SIM card you use is compatible with your phone model. Check that your primary and secondary SIM cards are set correctly.\r\n\r\n3.         Try restarting your phone.\r\n\r\n4.         If your SIM card is still not recognized after restarting your phone, try backing up your data and resetting your phone to factory settings. Insert the card again and check whether the card is recognized.\r\n\r\n5.         Check whether the SIM card is recognized by other phones and whether your phone can recognize other SIM cards.\r\n\r\n6.         If the previous suggestions don't work, it may be that the SIM card slot is damaged or there may be some other problem. Take your phone to an authorized Huawei service center for service.",
