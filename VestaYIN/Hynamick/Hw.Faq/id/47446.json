  "title": "On my phone, do SIM card slots 1 and 2 both support 4G? How do I switch SIM cards between slots?",
  "answer": "1.         Confirm that 4G service has been enabled for your SIM card.\r\n\r\n2.         SIM cards can be switched between slots. Card slot 1 and 2 both support 4G.\r\n\r\n3.         Go to **Settings** > **Wireless & networks** > **Dual card management** and select the card that has 4G service. When one card is designated as the 4G card, the other card will only support GSM service.\r\n\r\nDifferent phone models support various network standards. (See section 15.1 \"Product specifications\" and section 15.6 \"Card slot specifications\", or tell the user to reference the phone specifications on the Huawei official website.)\r\n\r\nNote: Shipped RIO-L01 phones include both single SIM card and dual SIM card versions. They can be differentiated through the menu:\r\n\r\nl   Single SIM card phones: **Settings** does not have a **Dual card management** menu.\r\n\r\nl   Dual SIM card phones: **Settings** does have a **Dual card management** menu.",
