  "title": "What is encrypted SMS?",
  "answer": "Â Encrypted SMS is a highly secure, encrypted messaging service. When encrypted SMS is used, messages are encrypted on the sender's phone before being sent. Recipients must decrypt messages using their Huawei ID password before they can be read. This makes SMS messages much more secure. Messages are stored on servers in an encrypted form or are kept in the phone's secure storage module. \r\n\r\nIn order to use encrypted SMS, both the sender and the recipient must use supported Huawei phones with the encrypted SMS feature enabled. To enable encrypted SMS, you must associate your phone number with a Huawei ID. A number can only be associated with one ID. An ID can be associated with more than one number. When you change your phone or SIM card, this account association will not be affected provided you retain your old number.",
