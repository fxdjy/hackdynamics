{"type":null,"faqId":5286,"title":"Why does the ADSL  connection break frequently?","answer":"Various factors can cause the problem, such as access server failure, line failure, line disturbance, network adaptor failure (low speed or earlier version of driver), or the HG failure (quality and compatibility). You can check as follows:\n(1) Make sure that the ADSL cable is connected properly，\n(2) Keep the HG away from appliances with strong electromagnetic fields, such as a microwave oven and a refrigerator，\n(3) Make sure that no telephone or fax machine is connected directly by the ADSL line，\n(4) Abandon the Ethernet network adapter that adopts the industry standard architecture (ISA) bus. Use the 10 M/100 M Ethernet network adapter that adopts the peripheral component interconnect (PCI) bus. Meanwhile, use the latest driver.\nIf the problem persists, contact the service provider.\n","faqTypeId":null,"faqType":null,"useful":0,"unUseful":0,"languageId":1,"languageName":"en","faqCode":"5286","faqTypeCode":null,"isTop":"0","moduleCode":"faq","productId":null,"productCode":null,"postDate":1264831975000,"seriesProductName":"","visitedTimes":16,"isUsefulFlag":null,"score":0,"times":0,"imageList":null,"displayType":"text","justView":"0","fileName":null,"filePath":null,"imagePath":null,"imageName":null,"productIdList":null,"curPage":null,"pageSize":null,"siteCode":null,"statusFlag":"Publish","returnCode":0,"totalRows":null,"keywords":null,"avgScore":0.0,"createDate":null,"totalPages":null}
