{"type":null,"faqId":26283,"title":"Why can't I draw a track when I partially capture the screen using my knuckles?","answer":"<p class=\"p1\"><span>Your phone implements partial screenshot based on the signals of the gravity sensor. If you slightly draw a circle on the screen, even when you use your knuckle, your phone can't receive the signals. You can rapidly draw a circle on the screen a little harder to achieve partial screenshot. You can practice for several times to master this operation. </span></p>","faqTypeId":null,"faqType":null,"useful":0,"unUseful":0,"languageId":1,"languageName":"en","faqCode":"643","faqTypeCode":null,"isTop":"0","moduleCode":"faq","productId":null,"productCode":null,"postDate":1432806089000,"seriesProductName":"GRA-L03","visitedTimes":46,"isUsefulFlag":null,"score":0,"times":0,"imageList":null,"displayType":"text","justView":"0","fileName":null,"filePath":null,"imagePath":null,"imageName":null,"productIdList":null,"curPage":null,"pageSize":null,"siteCode":null,"statusFlag":"Publish","returnCode":0,"totalRows":null,"keywords":null,"avgScore":0.0,"createDate":null,"totalPages":null}
