Keep the Bluetooth headset screen facing away from you vertical to the ground. Quickly rotate your wrist 90 degrees so the Bluetooth headset's&nbsp;screen is facing you. Wait for about 1 second for the screen to wake up. You may need to try this motion a few times to find an optimal rotation speed.</span>\n</p>\n<p  >\n<span>If you wake up the screen by rotating your wrist, you can switch between different pages by consecutively rotating your wrist.
