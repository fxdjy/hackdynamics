{"type":null,"faqId":10428,"title":"E5336Bs-2&Bs-6’s Wi-Fi signal is always weak","answer":"<p>\n1.When E5336Bs-2&amp;Bs-6 using it’s battery power,&nbsp;in order to save energy for longer run-time E5336Bs-2&amp;Bs-6 will lower down its transmit power ,so Wi-Fi signal is weaker compare with powered by USB or power adapter.&nbsp;Connect E5336Bs-2&amp;Bs-6 to power adapter or with USB cable to a running computer’s USB port will enhance E5336Bs-2&amp;Bs-6’s Wi-Fi signal strength.\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n2.&nbsp;Keep E5336Bs-2&amp;Bs-6 at least 3 to 6 feet away from other electrical devices which may create RF signal and cause interference (for example, microwave oven, TVs, cordless/cellular phones, baby monitors or wireless speakers).&nbsp;If you needn’t using any of those devices when you want to connect Internet, please turn it off.\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n3.Wi-Fi covered range of E5336Bs-2&amp;Bs-6 is according to its power supply mode and its using environment. In Idea clear square area the Wi-Fi covered range of E5336Bs-2&amp;Bs-6 showed below:\n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use power adapter: 100m(328ft)\n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use USB cable connect: 20m (66ft)\n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use battery supply: 10m (33ft)\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n4.In actual use Wi-Fi covered range maybe different from idea square area, it decided by the environment you use. The closer to E5336Bs-2&amp;Bs-6, the stronger Wi-Fi signal you get. And every obstacle (walls, ceilings, furniture) between your device and E5336Bs-2&amp;Bs-6 may decrease Wi-Fi signal strength. Move your device closer to E5336Bs-2&amp;Bs-6 can avoid obstacles and improve Wi-Fi signal.\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n5.Change the Wi-Fi channel to fix one other than auto (you can try the available channel one by one and select the channel with best signal strength)\n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>","faqTypeId":313,"faqType":"Power-on/Power-off","useful":7,"unUseful":4,"languageId":1,"languageName":"en","faqCode":"1162","faqTypeCode":"MBB_Device-Power-On-Off","isTop":"0","moduleCode":"faq","productId":null,"productCode":null,"postDate":1397554648000,"seriesProductName":"E5336Bs-2,E5336Bs-6","visitedTimes":275,"isUsefulFlag":null,"score":0,"times":0,"imageList":null,"displayType":"text","justView":"0","fileName":null,"filePath":null,"imagePath":null,"imageName":null,"productIdList":null,"curPage":null,"pageSize":null,"siteCode":null,"statusFlag":"Publish","returnCode":0,"totalRows":null,"keywords":"E5336Bs-2&Bs-6 signal","avgScore":0.0,"createDate":null,"totalPages":null}
