If you mostly wear it when exercising, the TalkBand B2's standby duration is about four to five days. </span>\n</p>\n<p  >\n<span>2. If you use it often, especially for power intensive activities such as calling or music, the TalkBand B2's standby duration is about one to two days.  </span>\n</p>\n<p  >\n<span>3. The TalkBand B2 comes with a touchscreen and supports features that other Bluetooth headsets do not have, such as fitness statistics collection. Its standby time will be reduced if you use screen wakeup by wrist rotation frequently. </span>\n</p>\n<p  >\n<span>(Note: The TalkBand B2's theoretical call time is up to 6 hours, which is longer than that of the common Bluetooth headsets.)</span>\n</p>\n<p  >\n<span>4. If your TalkBand B2 is connected to two phones and is frequently disconnected and reconnected from the phones, its standby time will be reduced. </span>\n</p>\n<p  >\n<span>5.
