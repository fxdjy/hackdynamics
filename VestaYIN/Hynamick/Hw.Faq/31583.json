With heavy use, the standby time is generally between 1 to 2 days (using it to make calls more than 4 hours a day or listen to WeChat voice messages or music often). </span>\n</p>\n<p  >\n<span>The battery's working time depends on how often you use the TalkBand B2 and how you use it. The TalkBand B2 comes with a touchscreen and exercise statistic collection feature that regular Bluetooth headsets do not have. The TalkBand B2 supports a calling time of about 6 hours, which is much longer than that of the regular Bluetooth headsets.</span>\n</p>\n<p  ></p>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>\n","faqTypeId":333,"faqType":"Battery, Charging, and Power Consumption","useful":0,"unUseful":1,"languageId":1,"languageName":"en","faqCode":"6083","faqTypeCode":"Wearable_Device-Battery-Charging-Consumption","isTop":"0","moduleCode":"faq","productId":null,"productCode":null,"postDate":1435059511000,"seriesProductName":"B2","visitedTimes":138,"isUsefulFlag":null,"score":0,"times":0,"imageList":null,"displayType":"text","justView":"0","fileName":null,"filePath":null,"imagePath":null,"imageName":null,"productIdList":null,"curPage":null,"pageSize":null,"siteCode":null,"statusFlag":"Publish","returnCode":0,"totalRows":null,"keywords":"B2,Huawei TalkBand B2","avgScore":0.0,"createDate":null,"totalPages":null}
