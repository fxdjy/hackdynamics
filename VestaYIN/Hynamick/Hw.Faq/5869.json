See the description of the wireless network adapter that is installed on the computer and check whether the wireless network adapter supports the 802.11b and 802.11g protocols.\nIf the wireless network adapter does not support the 802.11b and 802.11g protocols, replace it with the network adapter that supports the protocols.\n4. Check whether the driver for the wireless network adapter is properly installed on the computer.\nIf the driver is improperly installed, install it properly.\n5. Check whether the computer can receive the signals of a WLAN.\nTake a computer that runs Windows XP as an example.

Check whether the computer accesses the WLAN of the terminal successfully.\nCheck the list of wireless network connections and ensure that the terminal is connected to the WLAN.\n7. Check whether you can use the PPP dialing software to dial successfully.\n8. Try to access multiple Web sites to check whether the terminal can access other Web sites.\nIf the terminal cannot access other Web sites either, restore the default settings of the terminal. If the problem persists, contact your network service provider.","faqTypeId":null,"faqType":null,"useful":0,"unUseful":3,"languageId":1,"languageName":"en","faqCode":"5869","faqTypeCode":null,"isTop":"0","moduleCode":"faq","productId":null,"productCode":null,"postDate":1281075657000,"seriesProductName":"","visitedTimes":556,"isUsefulFlag":null,"score":0,"times":0,"imageList":null,"displayType":"text","justView":"0","fileName":null,"filePath":null,"imagePath":null,"imageName":null,"productIdList":null,"curPage":null,"pageSize":null,"siteCode":null,"statusFlag":"Publish","returnCode":0,"totalRows":null,"keywords":null,"avgScore":0.0,"createDate":null,"totalPages":null}
