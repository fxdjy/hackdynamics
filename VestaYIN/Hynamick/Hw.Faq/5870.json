{"type":null,"faqId":5870,"title":"After a broadband terminal is installed, does Internet access degrade call quality or do telephone calls lower the Internet access rate?","answer":"No. The terminal uses the frequency division multiplexing (FDM) and splitter technologies to separate voice signals from data signals. Although the two types of signals are transmitted through one telephone line, they are carried by different frequency bands. Therefore, they do not interfere with each other. In this case, you can make a telephone call and access the Internet at the same time, without degrading call quality or lowering the Internet access rate.","faqTypeId":null,"faqType":null,"useful":13,"unUseful":3,"languageId":1,"languageName":"en","faqCode":"5870","faqTypeCode":null,"isTop":"0","moduleCode":"faq","productId":null,"productCode":null,"postDate":1281075657000,"seriesProductName":"","visitedTimes":543,"isUsefulFlag":null,"score":6,"times":2,"imageList":null,"displayType":"text","justView":"0","fileName":null,"filePath":null,"imagePath":null,"imageName":null,"productIdList":null,"curPage":null,"pageSize":null,"siteCode":null,"statusFlag":"Publish","returnCode":0,"totalRows":null,"keywords":null,"avgScore":3.0,"createDate":null,"totalPages":null}
