For example, your phone may be connected to a Wi-Fi network or you may be near a strong router or microwave oven. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Bluetooth is a short-distance and ultra-low radiation transmission technology. We suggest the following when you use the Bluetooth headset for calling: </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>1. Keep your TalkBand B2 within 5 meters from the phone, without large obstacles between them. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>2. During the call, keep the Bluetooth headset and phone on the same side of your body to make sure the signals are not blocked. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>3. Turn off Wi-Fi on your phone or keep away from microwave sources, such as microwave ovens and high functioning routers. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>If the noise is periodic, it's probably due to normal environmental interference. If the noise is constant, take&nbsp;your TalkBand B2 to an authorized Huawei service center.</span>\n</p>\n</div>","faqTypeId":339,"faqType":"Miscellaneous","useful":1,"unUseful":0,"languageId":1,"languageName":"en","faqCode":"6139","faqTypeCode":"Wearable_Device-Others","isTop":"0","moduleCode":"faq","productId":null,"productCode":null,"postDate":1435059513000,"seriesProductName":"B2","visitedTimes":323,"isUsefulFlag":null,"score":0,"times":0,"imageList":null,"displayType":"text","justView":"0","fileName":null,"filePath":null,"imagePath":null,"imageName":null,"productIdList":null,"curPage":null,"pageSize":null,"siteCode":null,"statusFlag":"Publish","returnCode":0,"totalRows":null,"keywords":"B2,Huawei TalkBand B2","avgScore":0.0,"createDate":null,"totalPages":null}
