If you do not have a standard SIM card, save the contact information on the card and go to your carrier's service center to get a standard SIM card. Hand-cut SIM cards may not be recognized by your phone and may damage the card slot. If you use a hand-cut nano-SIM card, after cutting the card, make sure you polish the metal edges smooth before using.</p>\n<p style=\"LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt; TEXT-INDENT: -21.25pt; MARGIN: 4pt 0in 4pt 106.3pt; LAYOUT-GRID-MODE: char; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10.5pt; tab-stops: list 106.3pt\"><span><span>2.<span style=\"FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Make sure the SIM card you use is compatible with your phone model.
